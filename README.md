# README #

This repository contains scripts used by synbiomine.org to download data from various genetic databases. Some of this is loaded by existing InterMine data
transformers. Other data is transformed by further scripts into an item XML format that can be directly loaded into InterMine.

For instructions on generating a dataset from these scripts please see the wiki.
