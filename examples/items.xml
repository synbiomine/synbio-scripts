    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  While the jury is still out about whether Napoleon Bonaparte died of arsenic poisoning or cancer |CITS: [367316][6750413]|, it is agreed by all that arsenic is a potent toxin.  Indeed, the results of exposure to high arsenic concentration in drinking water in West Bengal, India, and Bangladesh are considered by some to be the worst public health disaster in recent history |CITS: [15276412]|.  The form of arsenic influences the type and severity of toxicity.  Arsenate (As&lt;sup&gt;V&lt;/sup&gt;) is a structural analog of phosphate, and inhibits phosphorylation processes.  For example, ADP-arsenate spontaneously hydrolyzes, resulting in uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation |CITS: [518594]|, while arsenite (As&lt;sup&gt;III&lt;/sup&gt;) has a very high affinity for thiol groups, and thus binds to and inhibits many key enzymes that have thiol groups in their active sites.  In addition, inorganic arsenic is a potent carcinogen |CITS: [12505313]|.  Arsenate enters the cell via the phosphate transport systems, such as the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |FRAME: PITA-MONOMER| and |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX &quot;Pst&quot;| systems.  Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes reduce intracellular arsenate to arsenite.  However, while prokaryotes can pump arsenite out of the cell by using a dedicated pump, multicellular organisms require other means of getting rid of the metal.  Certain mammals, including humans, continue by methylating the arsenite to several methylated forms that are excreted from the organism in the urine (see |FRAME: PWY-4202|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Most microorganisms are able to detoxify arsenic species by pumping them out of the cell.  This cytoplasmic detoxification system involves the &lt;i&gt;arsC&lt;/i&gt;-encoded cytoplasmic arsenate reductase, which reduces arsenate to arsenite, and an efficient arsenite efflux pump consisting of a two-component ATPase complex.  The &lt;i&gt;arsA&lt;/i&gt; gene product is a soluble ATPase subunit, while the &lt;i&gt;arsB&lt;/i&gt; product is an integral membrane protein.  Arsenite is the preferred substrate of ArsB, as well as an activator of ArsA ATPase activity.  In many cases &lt;i&gt;arsB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arsC&lt;/i&gt; are found in an operon without an &lt;i&gt;arsA&lt;/i&gt; gene |CITS: [12165430]|.  ArsC cytoplasmic arsenate reductases are found widely in microbes, and are found in almost all organisms with a genome larger than 2 Mb |CITS: [15691908]|.  There are three different clades of ArsC proteins in bacteria, which share no sequence similarity.  The first clade includes the glutathione-glutaredoxin-coupled enzymes, and is found in many Gram-negative bacteria, as well as carried on many plasmids.  The second clade consists of glutathione-only dependent enzymes, and is found only in yeast, while the third clade consists of thioredoxin-dependent enzymes, and is found in Gram-positive bacteria, as well as many Gram-negative proteobacteria.  In addition, archaebacteria also possess ArsC reductases.  The archaeal genes are closest to those of Gram-positive bacteria |CITS: [15691908]|. "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase complexes of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; convert 2-oxo acids to the corresponding acyl-CoA derivatives and produce NADH and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These large, multienzyme complexes include the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC) (see |FRAME:PYRUVDEHYD-PWY|) and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (OGDHC, shown here).  They consist of three enzyme components, a 2-oxo acid dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) (E1), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (E2), and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (E3). Components E1 and E2 are unique to each enzyme, while component E3 is functionally interchangeable between the two complexes |CITS: [6311808]|. E3 also functions in the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY|.  The &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 12, 24, and 2 units of the E1(o), E2(o), and E3 components, respectively whereas the |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| comprises 24, 24, and 12 units of the E1(p), E2(p), and E3 components, respectively. In both &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzymes the octahedral core of the complex is made up of 24 E2 units which contain lipoyllysine and binding sites for dimers of the other two subunits which are flexibly tethered to the E2 core |CITS: [16338405]|. The three subunits of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; OGDHC are a |FRAME: E1O| E1(o) encoded by &lt;i&gt;sucA&lt;/i&gt;, a |FRAME: E2O| E2(o) encoded by &lt;i&gt;sucB&lt;/i&gt;, and the |FRAME: E3-CPLX| E3 encoded by &lt;i&gt;lpd&lt;/i&gt; (synonym &lt;i&gt;lpdA&lt;/i&gt;).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The pathway illustrated here shows the reactions catalyzed by the |FRAME:2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX|, a key, rate-limiting enzyme of the |FRAME: TCA|. These reactions can be summarized by the general reaction |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-RXN| which is the form commonly found in the TCA cycle.   During the OGDHC reaction cycle, 2-oxoglutarate is bound and decarboxylated by E1(o), a thiamin-diphosphate cofactor containing enzyme. The succinyl group is transferred to the lipoyl domain of E2(o) where it is carried to the active site and transferred to coenzyme A, forming succinyl-CoA. During this transfer the lipoyl group is reduced to dihydrolipoyl. The succinyl-CoA is released and the lipoyl domain of E2(o) is oxidized by E3 via transfer of protons to NAD, forming NADH and regenerating the lipoyl group back to lipoyllysine for another cycle |CITS: [16338405]|.  Under aerobic growth conditions the OGDHC not only catalyzes a key reaction in the TCA cycle, it also provides succinyl-CoA for methionine and lysine biosynthesis (see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: DAPLYSINESYN-PWY|), the latter pathway also leading to peptidoglycan biosynthesis. The synthesis of the OGDHC is repressed by anaerobiosis and is also subject to glucose repression. It is induced by aerobic growth on acetate |CITS: [6311808][5319784]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) is the biochemically active form of pyridoxine 5'-phosphate (PNP) or vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. PLP is an essential cofactor of numerous metabolic enzymes, predominantly in amino acid metabolism. It is one of the most versatile cofactors that participates in transamination, decarboxylation, racemization, C&amp;alpha;-C&amp;beta; cleavage and &amp;alpha;-&amp;beta; elimination reactions. This vitamin has a role in numerous human body functions ranging from modulation of hormone function to its recent discovery as a potent antioxidant. Its &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis occurs only in bacteria, fungi and plants, making it an essential nutrient in the human diet.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The biosynthesis of this vitamin was thoroughly studied in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and involves two branches with seven enzymatic steps. In one branch, the sequential action of the enzymes Epd, PdxB and SerC results in the convesrion of erythrose 4-phosphate into 4-phosphohydroxy-L-threonine. The latter then undergoes oxidation and decarboxylation by PdxA to form 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate. In the other branch, deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate (DXP) is derived from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) and pyruvate by the action of Dxs. The products of the two branches, i.e. 3-hydroxy-1-aminoacetone phosphate and DXP, are then condensed by PdxJ to form PNP, which enters the salvage pathway to undergo oxidation by PdxH to form the PLP cofactor.  From the six pdx genes, two of them, &lt;i&gt;epd&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;serC&lt;/i&gt;, are involved in other metabolic processes, but &lt;i&gt;pdxA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pdxB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;pdxJ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pdxH&lt;/i&gt; are unique for PLP biosynthesis |CITS: [1537800]|. PdxJ, the PNP synthase is the key ezyme that catalyzes a multistep ring closure yielding PNP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This is the last step in the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthetic pathway.  An alternative and recently discovered DXP-independent pathway for PNP biosynthesis begins with glutamine in other micro-organisms and is very similar both structurally and mechanistically to the one in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.

    <attribute name="description" value="Even though NAD molecules are not consumed during oxidation reactions, they have a relatively short half-life. For example, in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; half-life is 90 minutes. Once enzymatically degraded, the pyrimidine moiety of the molecule can be recouped via the NAD salvage cycles. This pathway is used for two purposes: it recycles the internally degraded NAD products nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide (also known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN) and nicotinamide, and it is used for the assimilation of exogenous NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  Since the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; molecule is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake. It does seem to be able to penetrate the external membrane, though, as the enzymes that break it down are found in the periplasm |CITS: [2841298]|.  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is first hydrolyzed by NAD pyrophosphatase into NMN , which can be hydrolyzed further to nicotinamide by NMN nucleosidase. Both enzymes are periplasmic. Both NMN and nicotinamide can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. Once there, nicotinamide is converted via nicotinate to nicotinate nucleotide, at which point the pathway merges with the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis pathway, and continues to NAD via deamido-NAD.  There are several flavors of the salvage pathway found in different organisms, and even within the same organism. The one described above contains 6 reaction steps, and is often referred to as the PNC VI pathway, for Pyridine Nucleotide Cycling. However, there are also a four-step cycle and a five-step cycle, termed PNC IV and V,  respectively |CITS: [220211][6445894]|.  In the PNC IV cycle, the enzyme NMN amidohydrolase (also called NMN deamidase) converts NMN (which can be transported across the inner membrane in Enterobacteria) directly to nicotinate nucleotide, bypassing the enzymes nicotinamidase (PncA) and nicotine phosphoribosyl transferase (PncB), which are members of the PNC VI cycle. PNC IV is the major intracellular recycling pathway in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [7021549]|, while PNC VI is the major cycle of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [6445894]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="The pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis from threonine is a five-step pathway that shares its last four steps with the pathway of valine biosynthesis. These entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.  As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject to regulation by all three amino acids. The first enzyme in the pathway, L-threonine deaminase, is downregulated by isoleucine and leucine, but is upregulated by valine. The following pathway step, catalyzed by acetohydroxybutanoate synthases (AHAS) I and III, is inhibited by all three amino acids. This apparent paradox of valine stimulation of step one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the preference of AHAS III for processing of the isoleucine precursor 2-oxobutanoate rather than the valine precursor pyruvate. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS enzymes are inhibited, blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well. However, the stimulation of L-threonine deaminase generates a substantial pool of 2-oxobutanoate. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for this compound, this allows the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.  Enteric bacteria such as |FRAME:ECOLI| and |FRAME:TAX-90371| have been shown to possess two types of threonine dehydratases - a catabolic enzyme, which is induced by threonine, and a consistitutively- produced biosynthetic enzyme |CITS: [13405870]|. Both enzymes convert threonine to |FRAME:2-OXOBUTANOATE|, but differ in their regulation and expression.  Biosynthetic threonine dehydratases were also described in several soil bacteria |CITS: [16743051]|. A survey of 75 soil isolates capable of growth on L-threonine revealed a group of three organisms that possessed substantial L-threonine dehydratase activity, to the exclusion of any other threonine-catabolyzing enzyme|CITS: [5076220]|.  The group consisted of |FRAME:ORG-5895| and two &lt;i&gt;Brevibacterium&lt;/i&gt; isolates. The enzyme from |FRAME:ORG-5895| was partially purified, and was found to be of the biosynthetic type on the criteria that its formation was consitutive, it was susceptible to inhibition by |FRAME:ILE|, |FRAME:VAL| protected against denaturation and was a positive effector and antagonist of isoleucine, and neither AMP nor ADP acted as effectors |CITS: [16743051]|. Interestingly, even though the enzyme was of the biosynthetic type, the researchers found that much of the threonine in these organisms was converted to |FRAME:PROPIONATE| in a catabolic pathway identical to that described in |FRAME:PWY-5437|. Thus, the biosynthetic enzyme was recruited to a catabolic pathway.  A biosynthetic threonine dehydratase was also reported in |FRAME:TAX-615| |CITS: [355220]|."/>

Electrons from NADPH flow through these pathways via gradients in redox potentials.  Thioredoxin and glutaredoxin reduce disulfide bonds by a thiol-disulfide exchange mechanism involving two active site cysteine residues in the motif CXXC (where X is any amino acid) that form either a disulfide or a dithiol.  In addition to the importance of thiol redox potential |CITS: [10464247]|, other important factors in the thiol redox system are cellular location |CITS: [9724776]| and the overall redox state of the cell.  Both the thioredoxin and glutathione pathways appear to operate in parallel.

    <attribute name="description" value="Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the stomachs of their hosts.  &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt; contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid resistance system 2 (AR2) is the glutamate-dependent acid resistance system which couples the transport activity of a glutamate:4-aminobutyrate antiporter, GadC, with glutamate decarboxylase, GadA/GadB.  GadA or GadB is sufficient for survival at pH 2.5, but both GadA and GadB are required for survival at pH 2.0.  GadC functions by exchanging external glutamate for internal 4-aminobutyrate.  Glutamate is imported into the cell through GadC.  Within the cell glutamate is decarboxylated by GadA/GadB to 4-aminobutyrate, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and replacing it with a proton.  4-aminobutyrate is then exported through GadC.  This effectively consumes protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  An additional effect of the acid resistance systems that may be more important for survival is a reversal of the membrane potential such that a build-up of positive charges within the cell due to influx of protons and conversion of glutamate to 4-aminobutyrate will counteract proton influx beyond a certain limit.  ClC chloride channels provide a control mechanism to help maintain appropriate membrane potential by mediating chloride import coupled to proton export.  AR2 is more efficient than AR3 or AR4 as a mediator of acid  esistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746],[12964244]|  AR2 is also able provide acid resistance to &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt; growing under conditions of anaerobiosis and phosphate starvation (believed to reflect conditions in the gut), but to a slightly lesser degree than the lysine-dependent acid resistance system possibly due to the different pH optimums of their respective decarboxylase enzymes. |CITS:[17209032]| "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Phospholipids are important components of the inner and outer membranes of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Most phospholipids are |FRAME: Phosphoglycerides &quot;phosphoglycerides&quot;|. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE| (a phosphatidate), are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on C-1 and C-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to C-3 by an ester link.  Most of the fatty acids of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are contained in phospholipids. The three main phospholipids of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are  phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine comprises about 75% of the total phospholipid, with the latter two varying as to growth phase. Trace amounts of other phospholipids including monoacylphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine are also present.  The fatty acid composition of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; phospholipids consists of palmitate, myristate, palmitoleate, and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate, with trace amounts of laurate, stearate, and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-7-tetradecenoate. The proportions depend upon both growth phase and temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids rises with decreasing temperature, which is thought to maintain membrane fluidity.  Following the synthesis of the fatty acid components of phospholipids (see pathways under class |FRAME: Fatty-acid-biosynthesis|), they are transferred to a phosphorylated glycerol molecule (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|). The resulting |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE &quot;1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate&quot;| is then converted to its activated derivative |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. Following activation, it can then be modified to form other phsophoglycerides as shown in the pathway links.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| utilizing the PlsB and PlsC enzymes. It is found in some Gram-negative bacteria, primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|, including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. When cells are grown on carbon sources other than glycerol, the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis is the NADH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a glycolytic intermediate) to &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) catalyzed by |FRAME: GLYC3PDEHYDROGBIOSYN-CPLX|, the product of gene |FRAME: EG20091|. The enzyme is feedback-regulated by G3P which maintains a constant intracellular concentration of this metabolite |CITS: [6985897]|. When cells are grown on glycerol, |FRAME: GLYCEROL-KIN-CPLX| can produce G3P.  The production of the intermediate 1-acyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate is catalyzed by membrane-bound PlsB (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|). It transfers fatty acids to position 1 of G3P, producing |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P|. PlsB enzymes can utilize either an acyl-[acp] (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1319|) or an acyl-CoA thioester (this pathway) as the acyl donor. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can convert exogenous fatty acids into acyl-CoAs via FadD (|FRAME: ACYLCOASYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [6355102]|, which are also substrates for PlsB and PlsC.  The addition of the second fatty acid acyl moiety at position 2 of G3P is catalyzed by PlsC (|FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|), producing a 1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate (a phosphatidate). This enzyme is universally expressed in all bacteria. As in the case of PlsB, it can utilize either an acyl-[acp] or a long-chain acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor.  The a 1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate formed by PlsC is then converted to its activated form |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. This compound is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of all membrane phospholipids (as indicated in the pathway links and superpathway |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN-PWY|).  It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of 1-acyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate that involves genes &lt;i&gt;plsX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;plsY&lt;/i&gt;, as described in MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5981| |CITS: [16949372]|.

Being a strong reducing agent, it functions as an antioxidant and a redox buffer. It is also a cofactor for several enzymes, which are involved in many important pathways, including collagen hydroxylation, carnitine biosynthesis, norepinephrine biosynthesis, and hormone and tyrosine metabolism.  Under aerobic conditions L-ascorbate is oxidized in cells to |FRAME: CPD-13907 dehydroascorbate| (via the radical |FRAME: CPD-318|), which can be recycled back to ascorbate by the |FRAME: PWY-2261|. However, once formed, dehydroascorbate can be further broken down &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by irreversible reactions, escaping the  |FRAME: PWY-2261|.  Several pathways for the irreversible catabolism of ascorbate have been described. Facultatively aerobic bacteria such as  |FRAME: TAX-562| and |FRAME: TAX-573| degrade L-ascorbate by different pathways under aerobic and anaerobic conditions (see |FRAME: PWY-6961| and |FRAME: PWY0-301|).

The yiaK-S operon, which is controled by the YiaJ repressor, encodes two unique proteins - a reductase (|FRAME: EG12279|) and a kinase (|FRAME: EG12284 yiaP|) as well as three proteins that are paralogous to &lt;i&gt;ula&lt;/i&gt; operon proteins: a carboxylase (|FRAME: EG12285 yiaQ|) and two epimerases (|FRAME: EG12287 yiaS| and |FRAME: EG12286 yiaR|) (note tha many of these genes are now known under different names). YiaK and YiaP convert |FRAME: CPD-334| to |FRAME: CPD-2343|, which can be processed by the rest of the enzymes to |FRAME: XYLULOSE-5-PHOSPHATE|, a centeral metabolite that is fed into the pentose phosphate pathway.  Curiously, the &lt;i&gt;yia&lt;/i&gt; regulon is also regulated by |FRAME: L-ASCORBATE-6-PHOSPHATE|, a metabolite that can only be produced by the |FRAME: EIISGA|, which is encoded by the &lt;i&gt;ula&lt;/i&gt; regulon. Thus, efficient aerobic metabolism of L-ascorbate is dependent on the presence of both systems. In addition, the expression of the &lt;i&gt;yiaK-S&lt;/i&gt; operon, but not the expression of the &lt;i&gt;ula&lt;/i&gt; regulon, is regulated by oxygen availability. Both systems are regulated by the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-cAMP receptor protein (CRP) complex and by IHF |CITS: [18708499]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, a facultative anaerobe, is capable of mediating the mixed acid fermentation and thereby, in the absence of any of the exogenous electron acceptors that it can utilize (oxygen, fumarate, nitrate, nitrite, trimethylamine oxide, or dimethyl sulfoxide), able to grow on a variety of compounds including hexoses, hexitols, hexonic acids, and hexuronic acids.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ferments only when exogenous electron acceptors are not available.  In the shift from exogenous electron-dependent growth to the mixed acid fermentation, pyruvate dehydrogenase is no longer synthesized.  Instead, pyruvate formate-lyase, which cleaves pyruvate nonoxidatively to formate and acetyl-CoA, is made.  Formate is excreted as formic acid.  Some of the acetyl-CoA enters the remnant of the TCA cycle, which terminates at 2-oxoglutarate because 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase synthesis is repressed.  In spite of such repression, all components of the TCA cycle and therefore its essential precursor metabolites, continue to be made by the now two arms of the cycle: one, leading to 2-oxoglutarate, still oxidatively, and the other, leading to succinate, now reductively.  Succinate is excreted as succinic acid.  The acetyl-CoA not needed for these purposes is metabolized via acetylphosphate to acetate, thereby generating ATP.  The acetate so formed is excreted as acetic acid.  During the shift to the mixed acid fermentation, three additional enzymes are made: 1) a lactate dehydrogenase, which reduces pyruvate to lactate that is excreted as lactic acid; 2) an ethanol dehydrogenase, which reduces acetyl-CoA to acetaldehyde and subsequently to ethanol, which is excreted; 3) formic hydrogen lyase, which cleaves formate to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  The multiplicity of possible endproducts of fermentation with differing oxidation states and acidity permits &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to maintain redox balance and therefore to grow fermentatively on a broader range of substrates than would otherwise be possible.  When growing on a more reduced substrate such as glucitol, greater quantities of more reduced endproducts such as ethanol, acetic acid, and lactic acid are produced; on more oxidized substrates such as glucuronate, more of the oxidized endproducts, succinic acid and formic acid, are made.  Conversion of formate to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is regulated by pH.  Review: Bock, A. and Sawers, G., Chapter 18: Fermentation, in |CITS: [colisalII]|"/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;About lipoate&lt;/b&gt;  Lipoate is a sulfur-containing cofactor found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  It is utilized by several enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, including |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase |CITS: [2188967]|, and the |FRAME: GCVMULTI-CPLX| |CITS: [1655709][8444795]|.  Each of these enzyme complexes is composed of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific decarboxylase-dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) specific for each type of complex, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), and a flavoprotein that is a common component of these multienzyme complexes.  &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes both the decarboxylation of the &amp;alpha;-keto acid and the subsequent reductive acylation of the lipoyl moiety, which is covalently bound to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the acyl transfer step, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the reoxidation of the dihydrolipoyl moiety with NAD as the ultimate electron acceptor |CITS: [2188967]|.  The lipoate cofactor is bound to the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by an amide linkage between its carboxylate moiety and a specific lysine residue in the enzyme |CITS: [8444795]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The biosynthesis of lipoate is unusual, and shares the same mechanism as the biosynthesis of biotin.  The |FRAME: EG11796-MONOMER| (LplA) was initially described as acting only on lipoate that has been imported from outside the cell (see |FRAME: PWY0-522|) |CITS: [8002607]|.  However, a new role for this enzyme was found following the observation that &lt;i&gt;E. coli lipB&lt;/i&gt; mutants (defective in |FRAME: EG11591-MONOMER|) grew well with octanoate instead of lipoate |CITS: [14700636]|.  Octanoate growth required both |FRAME: EG11796-MONOMER| and |FRAME: CPLX0-782|, the enzyme that converts octanoyl side chains to lipoyl side chains, suggesting that |FRAME: EG11796-MONOMER| attached octanoate to the enzyme domain, and |FRAME: CPLX0-782| converted the octanoate to lipoate |CITS: [14700636]|.  The first enzyme in this pathway, lipoyl-protein ligase, transfers octanoate to specific lysyl residues in lipoate-dependent enzymes, resulting in the formation of octanylated domains.  The next enzyme in the pathway, lipoate synthase, catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain.  The enzyme is an iron-sulfur protein that requires the molecule S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) |CITS: [8444795][11106496]|.  An electron which originates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme serves to split at least two molecules of AdoMet into a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine |CITS: [11834738]|.  The radical then abstracts a hydrogen from a C-H bond of thew octanoyl side chain, becoming 5'-adenosine in the process.  The newly-formed unstable octanoyl radical then reacts directly with the Fe-S center of the enzyme.  Two sulfur atoms from the center enter the structure of the octanoyl side chain, producing lipoyl, which dissociates from the enzyme along with excess iron, leaving it with a [2Fe-2S] center.  Thus, in this unusual reaction, the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme is not just a catalytic accelerator, but also a substrate, donating the two sulfur atoms |CITS: [11153271]|.  It should be noted that while this process has been well documented &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [11106496]|, there is still a possibility that there exists another sulfur donor &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that the Fe-S center acts as sulfur donor only in the absence of this natural donor |CITS: [11395404]|."/>

Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.  Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The key enzyme in this salvage pathway is uridine-cytidine kinase (also known as uridine kinase, |FRAME: EC-2.7.1.48 &quot;EC 2.7.1.48&quot;|). This enzyme catalyzes the phosphorylation of the nucleosides |FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to their monophosphate forms.  The enzyme is found in archaea, bacteria, plants and animals, although some differences exists among the enzymes. For example, the enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-562| prefers GTP as the phosphate donor |CITS: [211379]|, while the mammalian enzyme prefers ATP.   Another enzyme that participates in the salvage of nucleosides is cytidine deaminase (|FRAME: EC-3.5.4.5 &quot;EC 3.5.4.5&quot;|). It has been shown in |FRAME: TAX-562| that exogenously supplied |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is not directly converted to CMP. Instead, a very active |FRAME: CYTIDEAM-CPLX| converts it rapidly to |FRAME: URIDINE|, which is phosphorylated to UMP, and eventually converted to UTP and CTP. However, exogenously supplied cytidine will be phosphorylated to CMP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation |CITS: [ColiSalII]|. "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesised &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; at the diphosphate level through reduction of the 2'-hydroxyl group of the corresponding ribonucleotides (see |FRAME: PWY-7184|). This reduction is mediated by the key enzyme |FRAME: EC-1.17.4.1 &quot;ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase&quot;|.  The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of ribonucleotides is very expensive, and organisms have adapted to salvage potential precursors from their environment. Since nucleotides can not be imported into the cell due to the negative charge of the phosphate groups, salvage is limited to free bases and nucleosides.   Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. It has been shown that in quiescent or terminally differentiated mammalian cells, resting in the G0 phase, ribonucleotide reductase is not produced due to a block during transcription and the cells rely on salvage for deoxyribonucleotides for DNA repair |CITS: [3044582][1696835]|.   The deoxyribonucleosides enter through the cell membrane by facilitated diffusion via a low affinity, high capacity, non-concentrative nucleoside carrier protein with a wide specificity, possessed by almost all animal cells |CITS: [3048401]|. The next step in the salvage pathway is the phosphorylation of the nucleosides to monophosphates. Once phosphorylation occurs, the nucleotides are trapped intracellularly due to their negative charge.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  As shown in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-7199|, the deoxyribonucleosides are imported into the cell and phosphorylated by deoxyribonucleoside kinases at the 5' position. The monophosphates are then phosphorylated further to form the triphosphates that are required for DNA synthesis, as described in this pathway.   |FRAME: TMP| is phosphorylated to the diphosphate form by a specific |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.9 &quot;dTMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.9)&quot;|, while |FRAME: DCMP| is phosphorylated in eukaryotes by the |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.14 &quot;bifunctional UMP/CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.14)&quot;| and in prokaryotes by a dedicated |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.25 &quot;(d)CMP kinase (EC 2.7.4.25)&quot;|.  Both diphosphates, |FRAME: DUDP| and |FRAME: DCDP|, are phosphorylated to the triphosphate forms by the broad-substrate range |FRAME: EC-2.7.4.6 &quot;nucleoside-diphosphate kinase (EC 2.7.4.6)&quot;|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The essential ribonucleoside triphosphates (|FRAME:UTP| and |FRAME:CTP|) can be synthesized either &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|) or by utilizing free pyrimidine bases (|FRAME: URACIL| and |FRAME: CYTOSINE|) or their nucleosides (|FRAME: URIDINE| and |FRAME: CYTIDINE|) by importing them from the environment. Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.  Salvage is very important for many types of organisms and cells. Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis). It is well documented that yeast prefer to salvage nucleobases, while animals prefer the salvage of nucleosides.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In this pathway, the pyrimidine nucleoside |FRAME: CYTIDINE| is first hydrolyzed to the nucleobase |FRAME: CYTOSINE| by removal of the ribose sugar by the enzyme |FRAME: YDR400W-MONOMER &quot;ribonucleoside nucleosidase&quot;| (|FRAME: EC-3.2.2.3 &quot;EC 3.2.2.3&quot;|). Cytosine is then deaminated by |FRAME: EC-3.5.4.1 &quot;cytosine deaminase (EC 3.5.4.1)&quot;| to the pyrimidine base |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [10024464][10469156]|.  The resulting uracil base can be salvaged to form a pyrimidine nucleotide (see |FRAME: PWY-7183| and |FRAME: PWY-7193|). Alternatively, uracil can be degraded to |FRAME: B-ALANINE| by releasing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a three step reductive pathway (|FRAME: PWY-3982|). &amp;beta;-Alanine is a precursor of pentothenate and coenzyme A.  The overall metabolic outcome of this pathway, the conversion of |FRAME: CYTIDINE| to |FRAME: URACIL|, can also be achieved by a different pathway, as described in |FRAME: PWY-6556|.  Mammals and plants do not have either of the enzymes of this pathway, and thus can not salvage cytosine by this route. Instead they utilize a nucleoside kinase-based pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-7183|). Plants can also salvage pyrimidine nucleosides via the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6556|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell.  Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.  Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds are often depicted as NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.  Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms.  In reactions where NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate.  During the reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (or NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while the second proton is released into the medium.  Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H -&gt; NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  Additional roles for NAD in the cell have been suggested, including involvement in transcriptional regulation, longevity, and age-associated diseases.  In yeast, it has been shown that NAD affects longevity and transcriptional silencing through the regulation of the Sir2p family of NAD-dependent deacetylases |CITS: [12648681][14724176]|.  NAD is synthesized via two major pathways in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway, and the salvage pathway.  In the prokaryotic &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway, the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate (see |FRAME: PYRIDNUCSYN-PWY|, while in eukaryotes the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway starts with  tryptophan (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway is an NAD salvage pathway which proceeds via the intermediate nicotinamide riboside (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-ribosylnicotinamide, or NR).  While the presence of this pathway has been suggested for several organisms including &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [12446641]|, it is of particular importance to &lt;i&gt;Haemophilus influenzae&lt;/i&gt; and other V-factor-dependent members of the &lt;i&gt;Pasteurella&lt;/i&gt; family.  These organisms lack the enzymes necessary for the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of NAD, as well as most of the enzymes for the more common NAD salvage pathway, and therefore require exogenous NAD supply in the form of one of the V-factor compounds, which include NADP, NAD, NMN, and NR.  However, only the non-phosphorylated V factor, NR, can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm, where it can be converted to NAD and NADP |CITS: [12446641]|.  Thus this pathway is critical for these organisms |CITS: [1694467]|.    Since NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, which is obtained from extracellular sources, is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake.  A key enzyme in this pathway is a periplasmic protein that hydrolyzes NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), and hydrolyzes NMN to nicotinamide riboside (NR) |CITS: [11395461]|.  The nicotinamide riboside thus formed is transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm, where it is it is converted back to NMN, and eventually, to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  The identity of the NR transporter has not been confirmed experimentally, but it is suggested that it is encoded by the &lt;i&gt;pnuC&lt;/i&gt; gene, although earlier work with the PnuC protein of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium suggested that it encodes the transport of NMN |CITS: [6216244][11395461]|.  NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is recycled in the same manner, following dephosphorylation to NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.  In &lt;i&gt;H. influenzae&lt;/i&gt;, this dephosphorylation is performed by the outer membrane glycoprotein &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; (P4), encoded by the &lt;i&gt;hel&lt;/i&gt; gene.   While the pathway is predicted to be present in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, it probably serves a minor role compared to &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis and the main NAD salvage cycle (|FRAME: PYRIDNUCSAL-PWY|).  Some of the enzymatic activities associated with this pathway have been described in &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt; as early as 1951 |CITS: [14907738]|, but it was only recently that the genes responsible for them were identified.  Surprisingly, several activities were found to be functions of the multifunctional protein NadR, which was initially believed to have a role in regulation only |CITS: [10464228][12446641]|.  "/>

In E.  coli  there are 14 reactions involved in the de novo synthesis of AMP and GMP and these are controlled  by 12 known genes. The genes occur mostly as unlinked single units or as small functional operons  carrying two or, at the most, three structural genes each.  The purR gene encodes a repressor  controlling the synthesis of the enzymes or purine biosynthesis.  Sequences similar to the protected  region (PUR box) in purF are present in the regulatory regions of purMN.  The expression of purR  was shown to be autoregulated, probably through blocking of transcription elongation by binding  of PurR to the two PUR boxes.  So far, six genes/operons have been reported to contain PUR box-like  sequences.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  While the amino acid L-ornithine is not involved directly in protein synthesis, it is an important intermediate in many metabolic pathways of prokaryotes and eukaryotes (see |FRAME: PWY-4984|, |FRAME: PWY-6409| and |FRAME: PWY-6003|).  In some bacteria L-ornithine-containing lipids and genes involved in their biosynthesis have been identified, but other bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; do not contain ornithine lipids (reviewed in |CITS: [19703488]|) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6818|).  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; L-ornithine is a precursor of the amino acid L-arginine and the polyamine putrescine, which is in turn a precursor of the polyamine spermidine.  In this pathway L-ornithine is biosynthesized from L-glutamate via &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated intermediates. The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the spontaneous cyclization of glutamate derivatives, which leads to L-proline biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PROSYN-PWY|), thus keeping the pathways leading to L-arginine and L-proline separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).  Two alternative pathways have evolved that differ in the way the key intermediate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another key intermediate, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In this pathway, which is less common but is found in the &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, forming L-ornithine and acetate.  In the other pathway, which is found in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine is recycled onto L-glutamate, regenerating &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate (see |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|).    &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In the ornithine biosynthesis pathway of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, L-glutamate is acetylated to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglutamate by the enzyme &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglutamate synthase, encoded by the &lt;i&gt;argA&lt;/i&gt; gene.  The acetyl donor for this reaction is acetyl-CoA.  &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate is then converted in several enzymatic steps to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-ornithine.  The acetyl group is removed in the form of acetate by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, encoded by the &lt;i&gt;argE&lt;/i&gt; gene, producing L-ornithine and acetate.  L-ornithine is a precursor of the amino acid L-arginine, as shown in the pathway link.  Review: Charlier, D. and N.

In that route GMP is synthesized via IMP and XMP, which is converted to GMP by the action of GMP synthetase, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate. Note that the free base guanine or the ribonucleoside guanosine are not produced via the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis pathway.  Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside guanosine and the base guanine, which can be further degraded via xanthine and urate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).  In some organisms urate is catabolized to basic building blocks (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5691|). However, both guanosine and guanine can be salvaged by certain enzymes and converted back to their nucleotide form as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|.  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; the latter pathway is the major salvage route.  Review: Jensen, K.F., G. Dandanell, B. Hove-Jensen and M.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Iron is an essential trace element. In the presence of oxygen, ferrous iron is oxidized to ferric iron which forms insoluble compounds, and is thus not available to organisms. As a result, the level of physiologically available iron can drop to far below 1 &amp;mu;M, and become growth-limiting for bacteria. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems called siderophores, which can complex and retract ferric iron ions. The siderophores are low molecular mass compounds, and have been generally divided into three main types: catecholate-, hydroxamate-, and carboxylate-siderophores.  The siderophores, which have a very high and specific affinity for |FRAME: FE+3|, are excreted out of the cell and bind the metal extracellularly. The siderophore-metal complex is transported back into the cell through specific binding proteins present in the bacterial membrane. In Gram-negative bacteria, the binding protein transports the ferric-siderophore into the periplasm, where a second transporter transports it into the cytosol |CITS: [12196166]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  |FRAME: ENTEROBACTIN Enterobactin| is a catecholate siderophore produced almost exclusively by enterobacteria |CITS:[4908639][4908541][3067977]|, although it has been reported in some Streptomyces species |CITS:[11267771]|. It is a cyclic compound made of three units of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine joined in a cyclic structure by lactone linkages (only the &amp;delta;-cis isomer of the ferric chelate is biologically active). Not only the cyclic molecule, but also the biosynthetic precursor 2,3-dihydroxy-N-benzoylserine and its linear dimer and trimer condensation products are able to transport iron into enterobacteria |CITS: [2139424][1831634]|.  Enterobactin is synthesized under iron-deficient conditions and excreted into the environment where it binds Fe(III) with high affinity and specificity. The ferrisiderophore complexes are taken up into the cell by specific transport components. Enterobactin synthesis is divided into two parts:  1) the conversion of |FRAME: CHORISMATE| to |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE|  2) the synthesis of enterobactin from |FRAME: 2-3-DIHYDROXYBENZOATE| and |FRAME:SER|.  The second part of the pathway can be summarized in a single reactiom (|FRAME: EC-6.3.2.14|):  |FRAME:ENTMULTI-RXN|  However, it is a rather complex process catalyzed by the different components of the non-ribosomal peptide synthase |FRAME: ENTMULTI-CPLX|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;   Tetrahydrofolate (vitamin B9, tetrahydropteroylmonoglutamate) and its derivatives are commonly termed folates. Folates are tripartite molecules made up of a pterin, 4-aminobenzoate, and L-glutamate moieties. The pterin is synthesized from GTP and 4-aminobenzoate is synthesized from chorismate as shown in the pathway links to |FRAME: PWY-6147| and |FRAME: PWY-6543|, respectively.  The product of this pathway, tetrahydrofolate, is merely the parent structure of this large family of coenzymes. Members of the family differ in the oxidation state of the pteridine ring, the character of the one-carbon substituent at the N5 and N10 positions, and the number of glutamate residues. The glutamate residues are conjugated one to another via a series of &amp;gamma;-glutamyl links to form an oligo-&amp;gamma;-glutamyl tail, as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-2161|.  Folates are essential cofactors that facilitate the transfer of one-carbon units from donor molecules into important biosynthetic pathways. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; folates lead to the biosynthesis of methionine, purines, thymidylate and pantothenate (see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6123|, |FRAME: PWY0-166|, and |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|). They also mediate the interconversion of serine and glycine (see pathway |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|) and participate in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: N-formyl-L-methionyl-tRNAfmet|. Folates are biosynthesized &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; by bacteria, fungi and plants. Vertebrates are dependent on nutritional sources of folate, making it a vitamin. In addition to the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway, many organisms also possess salvage pathways that are used to re-synthesize tetrahydrofolate from pre-existing derivatives of folates in the cell (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6613|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Dihydropteroate synthase encoded by &lt;i&gt;folP&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the condensation of 4-aminobenzoate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzoate) with 6-hydroxymethyl-dihydropterin diphosphate to produce 7,8-dihydropteroate (dihydropteroate) |CITS: [4304228]|. Sulfonamide derivatives (sulfa drugs) are structural analogs of 4-aminobenzoate that compete with this substrate for the enzyme. Several mechanisms of sulfonamide resistance can develop, including mutations in &lt;i&gt;folP&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [9449266][8304179]|.   Dihydrofolate synthetase encoded by &lt;i&gt;folC&lt;/i&gt; then catalyzes the synthesis of dihydrofolate from dihydropteroate, L-glutamate and ATP |CITS: [14114858]|. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; FolC is a bifunctional enzyme that also catalyzes subsequent additions of L-glutamate to tetrahydrofolate (folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamate synthetase activity) |CITS: [2985605]| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-2161|). The &lt;i&gt;folC&lt;/i&gt; gene has been shown to be essential in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [1548226]|.  Dihydrofolate reductase encoded by &lt;i&gt;folA&lt;/i&gt; is the major enzyme responsible for reducing 7,8-dihydrofolate monoglutamate (dihydrofolate) to physiologically active tetrahydrofolate. Its substrate dihydrofolate is also a product of |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| encoded by &lt;i&gt;thyA&lt;/i&gt; during &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine biosynthesis (|FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-RXN|). Because |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX| utilizes both the tetrahydrofolate derivative 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and dUMP as substrates, dihydrofolate reductase must quickly reduce dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate when thymidylate is being synthesized in order to maintain cellular stores of tetrahydrofolate derivatives.  Strains containing a deletion of &lt;i&gt;folA&lt;/i&gt; have been isolated from &lt;i&gt;thyA&lt;/i&gt; strains, suggesting the existence of another enzyme with dihydrofolate reductase activity. FolM is considered to be a candidate for this |CITS: [14617668]|, although its physiological role is incompletely understood.  Another candidate was suggested to be |FRAME: DIHYDROPTERIREDUCT-CPLX| encoded by &lt;i&gt;nfsB&lt;/i&gt; which was reported to have dihydrofolate reductase activity |CITS: [1418677]|, although more studies are needed to support this.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Adenosine nucleotides can be synthesized either &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;, or by recycling of the free base adenine and the ribonucleoside adenosine.  In the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; route AMP is synthesized via IMP and adenylo-succinate, which is converted to AMP by the action of |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (see |FRAME: PWY-6126|).  Note that adenine and adenosine are not produced via the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway.  However, the distinction between nucleoside degradation and recycling via salvage pathways is not always straightforward.  Salvage pathways start with the nucleoside or free base forms and lead to the formation of the nucleotide forms.  Degradation pathways usually start with the nucleotide form and end with compounds such as urate, that may lead to production of energy and provision of nitrogen and carbon.  Many organisms including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can recycle adenosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the degradation pathways are responsible for the conversion of nucleotides (AMP) to nucleosides (adenosine) (see pathway |FRAME: SALVADEHYPOX-PWY|) and free bases (adenine) (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6617|).  In the former pathway, adenosine is further degraded to urate.  Although radiolabelled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase that catalyzes the degradation of urate to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allantoin, no such enzyme has been detected in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [10986234]|.  Three variants of salvage pathways for adenosine and adenine found in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are shown in this pathway, pathway |FRAME: PWY-6609| and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6611|.  Purine salvage pathways also ensure that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; mutants that are unable to synthesize the intermediate IMP by the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathways can obtain any purine bases or purine nucleosides that are present in the growth medium.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This salvage pathway describes a route by which &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can recycle the free base adenine to produce adenosine and guanosine nucleotides.  A key enzyme in this pathway is |FRAME: CPLX0-322|, which catalyzes the direct phosphorylation of inosine to IMP and guanosine to GMP.  This enzyme has been observed in only some bacterial species |CITS: [11129609]| including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [7665468][10879466]|.  Review: Jensen, K.F., G. Dandanell, B.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) are unique and complex glycolipids that provide characteristic components of the outer monolayer of the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Wild type LPS is composed of a hydrophobic domain lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated &quot;core&quot; oligosaccharide (core OS) and a distal O-specific polysaccharide (or O-antigen). Strains of &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt; K-12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|. O antigens are not needed for growth in the laboratory, but they protect bacteria from antibiotics and complement-mediated lysis. The lipid A and Kdo domains of LPS are required for growth |CITS: [17362200][12045108]|.   The lipid A (endotoxin) domain of LPS is a unique, glucosamine-based saccharolipid that serves as the hydrophobic anchor of LPS. It is the bioactive component of the molecule that is associated with gram-negative septic shock |CITS: [15052329]|. There are approximately 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; lipid A residues in an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cell |CITS: [17362200]|. Lipid A of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; consists of a &amp;beta; (1'-&gt;6)-linked D-glucosamine disaccharide that carries four (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl groups in positions 2, 3, 2', and 3' and two phosphoryl residues in positions 1 and 4'. The hydroxy fatty acids at positions 2' and 3' are acylated at their 3-hydroxyl groups by dodecanoic acid and tetradecanoic acid, respectively |CITS: [3317748]|. Given their conserved architecture, most types of lipid A molecules are detected at picomolar levels by TLR4 (toll-like receptor 4) of the innate immune system present on macrophages and endothelial cells of animals |CITS: [12045108]|.  The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: the inner core (lipid A proximal) and the outer core. The inner core is highly conserved. It comprises three 3-deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) residues and it is often phosphorylated. Structural diversity in the core oligosaccharide is limited by the constraints imposed by its essential role in outer membrane stability |CITS: [12935355][9791168]|. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; mutants that lack the heptose region of the inner core display the &quot;deep rough&quot; phenotype characterized by changes in both the structure and the composition of the outer membrane leading to its instability |CITS: [385128]|. Deep rough mutants of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; activate expression of colanic acid exopolysaccharide, lose expression of pili and flagella and secrete a form of hemolysin with reduced hemolytic activity |CITS: [1348243]|. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core region provides an attachment site for O antigen |CITS: [9791168]|. Mutations that eliminate synthesis of the outer core result in increased susceptibility to some hydrophobic compounds due to an indirect effect on core phosphorylation |CITS: [2168379]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; lipid A is synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane by a conserved pathway of nine constitutive enzymes. The first reaction of lipid A biosynthesis is the acylation of the sugar nucleotide UDP-GlcNAc by LpxA. Deacetylation of the product, UDP-3-O-(acyl)-GlcNAc by the zinc metalloenzyme LpxC is the committed reaction of the pathway. LpxC is an excellent target for the design of novel, gram-negative specific antibiotics. Following deacetylation, a second beta-hydroxymyristate moiety is incorporated by LpxD to generate UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine. UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine is cleaved at its pyrophosphate bond by the highly selective pyrophosphatase LpxH to form 2,3-diacylglucosamine-1-phosphate (lipid X). A beta,1'-6 linked disaccharide is then generated by the condensation of another molecule of UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine with lipid X by LpxB. A specific kinase, LpxK next phosphorylates the 4' position of the disaccharide to form lipid IVA. The kinase product, lipid IVA, is of great interest because it possesses some of the properties of endotoxins |CITS: [12045108]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; LPS contains two Kdo residues that are transferred to lipid IVA by a bifunctional enzyme, encoded by &lt;i&gt;waaA&lt;/i&gt;. The chromosomal waa region (formerly rfa) contains the major core-oligosaccharide assembly operons, and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 provided the first waa region sequenced in its entirety |CITS: [12935355]|. The last steps of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; lipid A biosynthesis involve the addition of lauroyl and myristoyl residues to the distal glucosamine unit (generating acyloxyacyl moieties by LpxL and LpxM respectively. The completed lipid A-Kdo2 serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide and lipo-oligosaccharide chains are assembled.   The lipid A-core portion (known as rough LPS (R-LPS)) is synthesized by a conserved pathway. The mechanism involves sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors with a co-coordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases (Waa proteins) acting at the cytoplasmic surface of the inner membrane (IM). The modification of the core region of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; LPS requires the action of three enzymes, &lt;i&gt;viz.&lt;/i&gt; WaaP (an LPS kinase), WaaY (an enzyme required for a second phosphorylation) and WaaQ (a transferase that adds the side-branch heptose). The WaaP enzyme is the most important of these activities since the modifications must proceed in the strict order WaaPQY. Mutants lacking WaaP activity exhibit the deep rough phenotype and are avirulent. Mutant LPSs lacking the outer core (&lt;i&gt;waaG&lt;/i&gt;) are phosphorylated inefficiently by WaaP |CITS: [10986272]|. Conversely, the loss of phosphorylation results in a decreased efficiency of core extension, leading to more truncated cores than seen in the wild type.   The lipid A-core is then flipped to the outer surface of the inner membrane by the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, MsbA. An additional integral membrane protein, YhjD, has recently been implicated in LPS export across the IM. The smallest LPS derivative that supports viability in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is lipid IVA. However, it requires mutations in either MsbA or YhjD, to suppress the normally lethal consequence of an incomplete lipid A |CITS: [18480051]|. Recent studies with deletion mutants implicate the periplasmic protein LptA, the cytosolic protein LptB, and the IM proteins LptC, LptF, and LptG in the subsequent transport of nascent LPS to the outer membrane (OM), where the LptD/LptE complex flips LPS to the outer surface |CITS: [18768814]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="The glyoxylate cycle is a sequence of anaplerotic reactions that enables an organism to use substrates that enter central carbon metabolism at the level of |FRAME:ACETYL-COA| as the sole carbon source.

The pathway is essentially a modified version of the |FRAME:TCA| that bypasses those steps in the cycle that lead to a loss of |FRAME:CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  The glyoxylate cycle uses a two-step bypass.  The first key enzyme, |FRAME:ISOCIT-LYASE| (EC 4.1.3.1), converts |FRAME: THREO-DS-ISO-CITRATE| to form |FRAME: SUC| and |FRAME: GLYOX|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The sulfonation of biological compounds (sulfoconjugation) is a fundamental metabolic process, in which a sulfate group is added to an oxygen moiety to form a sulfate ester bond. The sulfonation of biomolecules occurs widely and results in a dramatic change in the physicochemical property of the sulfonated compounds |CITS: [Huxtable86]|. Sulfonation, is widely observed from bacteria to humans and plays a key role in various biological processes such as cell communication, growth and development, and defense |CITS: [11396917]|  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In the course of sulfonation, inorganic sulfate must be activated prior to being transferred to an acceptor molecule |CITS: [13851709]|. The known forms of activated sulfate are adenosine 5-phosphosulfate (APS) and 3-phosphoadenosine 5-phosphosulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [2828368]|.   Enzymatic reduction of sulfate requires its prior activation to a phosphosulfate-mixed anhydride, which in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; occurs through the ATP sulfurylase-catalyzed reaction of sulfate with ATP to give adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate (APS) and PPi |CITS: [13575437]|. A second enzyme, APS kinase, phosphorylates APS with another ATP to give 3'-phosphoadenylsulfate (PAPS) |CITS: [Robbins56]|, which is then enzymatically reduced by PAPS sulfotransferase (also known as PAPS reductase) to sulfite.   ATP sulfurylase is encoded by &lt;i&gt;cysD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;cysN&lt;/i&gt;, and APS kinase is encoded by &lt;i&gt;cysC&lt;/i&gt; with all three genes located in the &lt;i&gt;cys&lt;/i&gt;DNC cluster |CITS: [2828368][1316900][3275623]|. The &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP sulfurylase enzyme has two nonidentical subunits, a 35-kDa catalytic subunit encoded by &lt;i&gt;cysD&lt;/i&gt; and a 53-kDa peptide encoded by &lt;i&gt;cysN&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [2828368][1316900]|. The native enzyme is thought to contain four each of the two different subunits |CITS: [8117661]|. GTP stimulates the rate of APS synthesis as much as 116-fold with an apparent K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of 19 &amp;micro;M and is hydrolyzed in the process |CITS: [1730615]|. When coupled with APS synthesis, GTP hydrolysis lowers the apparent K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; for the overall reaction by a factor of about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; |CITS: [8299360][9521709]|. The enzyme mechanism involves the GTP-dependent formation of an AMP-enzyme reaction intermediate, which then undergoes nucleophilic attack by sulfate to give APS |CITS: [8117661]|.   &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; APS kinase is composed of identical 22-kDa peptides encoded by &lt;i&gt;cysC&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [2828368][1316900][1332767]|. The peptide subunit is phosphorylated by ATP at Ser-109 |CITS: [1332767]| and exists as a dimer in the phosphorylated state and mostly as a tetramer in the unphosphorylated state |CITS: [2549047]|. The phosphorylated enzyme probably represents an intermediate on the reaction pathway and can donate its phosphate either to APS to give the product PAPS or to ADP to re-form the substrate ATP.

    <attribute name="description" value="Glycerol uptake in bacteria is mediated by the glycerol diffusion facilitator, an integral membrane protein  catalyzing the rapid equilibration of concentration gradients of glycerol across the cytoplasmic  membrane |CITS: [8436953]|.  Intracellular glycerol is converted to glycerol-3-Phosphate (Glycerol-3-P) by the enzyme glycerol kinase that uses  ATP as phosphoryl donor. Glycerol-3-P is not a substrate of the glycerol diffusion facilitator and thus remains  in the cell, where it is further metabolized.  As a result, the driving force for the uptake of glycerol is generated by the  phosphorylation of glycerol by glycerol kinase |CITS: [9162046]|.    While Glycerol-3-P can not leave the cytoplasm, it can be imported into  the cell by the GlpT transporter, a member of the major facilitator superfamily, that couples the import of glycerol-3-P  into the cytoplasm to the export of inorganic phosphates from the cytoplasm to the periplasm  |CITS: [3522583][12893936]|.    In addition, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K12 possesses two systems the salvage of glycerophosphoryl diesters, the Glp system and the Ugp system.   In the Glp system, the &lt;i&gt;glpQ&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a periplasmic glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (periplasmic GDP) which hydrolyzes deacylated phospholipids to an alcohol plus Glycerol-3-P . The Glycerol-3-P is then transported into the cell by the GlpT transporter. Periplasmic GDP is specific for the glycerophospho- moiety of the substrate, while the alcohol can be any one of several alcohols. This provides the cell with the capability of channeling a wide variety of glycerophosphodiesters into the &lt;i&gt;glpQT&lt;/i&gt;-encoded dissimilatory system.   In the Ugp system the diesters are hydrolyzed during transport at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane to Glycerol-3-P plus alcohol by a cytoplasmic GDP, an enzyme encoded by the &lt;i&gt;ugpQ&lt;/i&gt; gene.  The Ugp system is induced when the cells are starved for inorganic phospate, which is  generates phosphate by  the system |CITS: [1851953]|.    In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; glycerol-3-P can be further metabolized to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) by either of two  membrane-bound enzymes, depending on the growth conditions. The presumed role of this process is the salvage  of glycerol and glycerol phosphates generated by the breakdown of phospholipids and triacylglycerol.  Under aerobic conditions, a homodimeric aerobic glycerol-3-P  dehydrogenase (encoded by the &lt;i&gt;glpD&lt;/i&gt; gene) is produced, which can accept either oxygen or nitrate as the  electron acceptor |CITS: [340460]|.   Under anaerobic conditions, a different glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase is preferentially expressed. This  tri-heteromeric protein complex, which is encoded by the &lt;i&gt;glpACB&lt;/i&gt; opron, channels the electrons from  glycerol-3-P to either fumarate or nitrate |CITS: [3286606]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Tetrapyrroles are compounds whose molecules have four rings of the pyrrole type, generally linked together by single-atom bridges between the alpha positions of the five-membered pyrrole rings. Tetrapyrroles function as a metal-binding cofactor in many important enzymes, proteins and pigments, such as heme, chlorophyll, cobalamine (vitamin B12), siroheme, and cofator F430.  The biosynthesis of all of these cofactors start in a similar manner, with the production of the intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III. This intermediate is an important branch point: its methylation directs it toward siroheme, cobalamin or cofactor F430 synthesis, while decarboxylation directs it toward the synthesis of heme and chlorophyll |CITS: [14633982]|.   The tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway starting point can be either glycine or glutamate. The pathway shown here starts with glutamate. However, regardless of whether the starting point is glycine or glutamate, both pathways converge at the intermediate 5-amino-levulinate and proceed through the important intermediate uroporphyrinogen-III, which is a major branch point that leads to biosynthesis of different tetrapyrrole compounds, such as the corrinoid cobalamine (vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), the methanogenic coenzyme F&lt;sub&gt;430&lt;/sub&gt; (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|),  |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|, and heme D.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) can be considered to be the first universal, committed tetrapyrrole precursor. This pathway is called the five-carbon pathway because ALA is formed from the intact five-carbon skeleton of glutamate (glu). In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the transformation of glu to ALA consists of three enzyme-catalyzed steps. In the first step, glu is activated by ligation to tRNA in a reaction identical to the tRNA-charging reaction in protein biosynthesis, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GltX). Like aminoacyl-tRNA formation, this reaction requires ATP and Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Next, the glu is converted to a reduced form in a reaction that requires a reduced pyridine nucleotide, catalyzed by glutamyl-tRNA reductase (HemA). The product of this reduction has been characterized as glu 1-semialdehyde (GSA). Finally, the positions of the nitrogen and oxo atoms of the reduced five-carbon intermediate are interchanged to form ALA, catalyzed by the enzyme GSA aminotransferase (HemL).   Porphobilinogen (PBG) synthase (HemB) catalyzes the asymmetric condensation of two ALA molecules to form PBG, with the release of two molecules of water. The amino group of this ALA molecule is a critical component of the binding site for the other ALA molecule. During the formation of PBG, removal of hydrogen to form the aromatic pyrrole ring must occur on the enzyme, as is indicated by the stereospecific retention the hydrogen atom that is derived from the pro-S C5 hydrogen of ALA. The reaction requires no external energy source. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; PBG synthase requires Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; for activity.   Uroporphyrinogen III, the last common precursor of all end product tetrapyrroles, is synthesized from PBG by the sequential action of two enzymes, hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) synthase (HemC) and uroporphyrinogen III synthase (HemD). HMB synthase condenses four PBG molecules to form the first tetrapyrrole, HMB. The released product, free HMB, rapidly cyclizes spontaneously and irreversibly to form the nonphysiological product uroporphyrinogen I. Biosynthesis of the biologically relevant isomer, uroporphyrinogen III, requires the presence of a second enzyme, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, during or immediately after release of HMB.  An initially puzzling report showed that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;hemB&lt;/i&gt; mutant cells, which were unable to form active PBG synthase, were also deficient in HMB synthase activity unless PBG was supplied in the medium.  Finally, highly purified recombinant &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; HMB synthase was discovered to contain a covalently bound dipyrromethane (dipyrrole) that is an essential cofactor for enzyme activity. The cofactor is synthesized from HMB and is ligated to a Cys residue (C242 of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme). Once bound, the dipyrrole cofactor remains permanently attached to the enzyme, and its free &amp;alpha;-position serves as a ligand for oligomerization of PBG substrate units to form the tetrapyrrole product. Scission of the link between the cofactor and the nascent oligopyrrole chain after the hexapyrrole stage is reached releases HMB and prepares the enzyme-bound dipyrrole cofactor to accept new substrate molecules. The existence of the dipyrrole cofactor explains the previously reported requirement for PBG to obtain active hydroxymethylbilane synthase in &lt;i&gt;hemB&lt;/i&gt; mutant &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cells.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  In prokaryotes and eukaryotes heme (protoheme IX, protoheme, heme &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.  Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as protoheme IX, different derivatives of protoheme IX can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including the way it is bound to the protein, such as heme &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, heme &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, heme &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, and heme &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.  In various organisms important branch points within the heme biosynthetic pathway lead to the biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), coenzyme F430 (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5196|), siroheme (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D (see EcoCyc reaction |FRAME: RXN-8073|), and bacteriochlorophyll (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; heme biosynthesis begins with L-glutamate and proceeds through 5-amino-levulinate (the universal tetrapyrrole precursor) to uroporphyrinogen III as shown in the |FRAME: PWY-5188| pathway link.  Uroporphyrinogen III is converted to protoheme IX in the pathway shown here.  Subsequent reactions that produce heme &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; and heme &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; are shown in the reaction links.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; hemes &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; function as the prosthetic groups for &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-type cytochromes, cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bd&lt;/i&gt;, and cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bo&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.  The &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-type cytochromes are synthesized only anaerobically in the presence of nitrogenous electron acceptors.  Cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bd&lt;/i&gt;, and cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bo&lt;/i&gt; are O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reducing terminal oxidase complexes.  Although regulation of heme biosynthesis is not well studied in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, evidence suggests that the cellular level of free protoheme IX controls the rate of heme synthesis at the level of formation of glutamate-1-semialdehyde by glutamyl-tRNA reductase encoded by &lt;i&gt;hemA&lt;/i&gt; (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5188|).  Review: Beale, S.I. (2007) &quot;Biosynthesis of Hemes&quot; EcoSal 3.6.3.11 |CITS: [ecosal]|  Reviews:  |CITS: [13680202], [12177321], [16093570] [20506125]|  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The pathway shown here from uroporphyrinogen III to protoheme IX is a segment of the overall heme biosynthetic pathway. The pathway links at the beginning and end of this pathway show the preceding and succeeding steps.  The main difference between this protoheme biosynthetic pathway and the pathway shown in |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II| is the presence of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen III dehydrogenase (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition from coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX without the need for molecular oxygen.  This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but has not been verified to be present in archaea or eukaryotes.  In this pathway the four acetate groups of uroporphyrinogen III are sequentially decarboxylated and the methyl groups from these four acetates remain in coproporphyrinogen III.  Two propionate groups at positions 3 and 8 of coproporphyrinogen III are decarboxylated to vinyl groups.  In  the facultatively aerobic &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent enzyme coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;hemN&lt;/i&gt; can function under anaerobic conditions.  HemN contains an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster |CITS: [14633981]|.  Under aerobic conditions the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-requiring product of gene &lt;i&gt;hemF&lt;/i&gt; produces protoporphyrinogen IX |CITS: [12975365]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II|).  In the next step six electrons are removed from protoporphyrinogen IX by a membrane-associated oxidase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;hemG&lt;/i&gt; forming protoporphyrin IX. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; under anaerobic conditions this oxidation is coupled to the reduction of nitrate or fumarate.  Under aerobic conditions this enzyme uses O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as electron acceptor |CITS: [20484676][365243]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEME-BIOSYNTHESIS-II|).  The final step forming heme (protoheme IX) is catalyzes by ferrichelatase which inserts Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; into protoporphyrin IX.          Review: Beale, S.I.

The pathway is fed acetoacetyl-ACP (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|)  which  is a substrate of the second reaction shown here. The products of multiple turns of this cycle that are drawn  off to become components of fatty acid-containing compounds such as phospholipids, lipid A, and lipoproteins are  the saturated fatty acids , lauric (dodecanoic), myristic (tetradecanoic), palmitic (hexadecanoic), and stearic  (octadecanoic) acids. &lt;i&gt;E. coli &lt;/i&gt; also contains unsaturated fatty acids. These are formed by a pathway (see |FRAME:PWY0-862|) that branches at the level of the 10-carbon intermediate. |CITS: [14527277]| |CITS: [8246839]|. The final step of the cycle, the reductase, once thought to be catalyzed by two enzymes, has been  shown to be catalyzed by a single enzyme, FabI, that can use either NADH or NADPH as a cofactor. However, the activity with NADH was over 17-fold higher than with NADPH |CITS: [9022698]|, thus the designation of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme as EC 1.3.1.9.

FabH initiates fatty-acid synthesis: it uses only acetyl-ACP as a substrate  (see Pathway |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) |CITS: [14523010]|. Only FabB catalyzes one step in the synthesis  of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [11566998]|  The activity of FabF and hence the fraction of fatty acids that are  unsaturated in modultated by temperature.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Microorganisms and mammals share two of the major, initial routes for threonine degradation.  In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate.  A biosynthetic version of this enzyme also occurs (see |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA. The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be spontaneously converted to aminoacetone, which may be further metabolized to methylglyoxal (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi.  This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:LTAA-CPLX| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into glycine and acetaldehyde.  &lt;i&gt;Escherichia. coli&lt;/i&gt; has been shown to assimilate nitrogen from some (but not all) amino acids, as well as agmatine, &amp;gamma;-aminobutyrate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine.  These nitrogen sources are used to generate glutamate and glutamine, the major intracellular nitrogen donors.  Some nitrogen sources, such as aspartate, can generate glutamate by transamination (see |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|).  Others, such as proline and arginine, produce glutamate as end products (glutamate generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| and |FRAME: AST-PWY|).  Other nitrogen sources, such as serine, require ammonia production for glutamate synthesis (ammonia generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Ammonia generation is required for glutamine synthesis (see |FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|).  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; a low intracellular level of ammonia results in low intracellular glutamine and induction of the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response that involves response regulators |FRAME: GLNG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLNL-CPLX|.  The Ntr response functions in ammonia assimilation, nitrogen scavenging and metabolic coordination.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has three systems that can transport threonine:  |FRAME: YGJU-MONOMER| |CITS: [12097162]|, |FRAME: ABC-15-CPLX| |CITS: [4583203]|, and |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| |CITS: [2115866]|.  Although &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can use threonine, glycine, or serine as a nitrogen source, efficient serine or threonine utilization requires amino acid supplementation.  Leucine supplementation is required for the use of threonine as a nitrogen source in pathways utilizing |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) which is induced by leucine |CITS: [334738]| (see |FRAME: THREONINE-DEG2-PWY| and |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  TDH is is a major route for threonine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  A minor pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5436| and an anaerobic pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5437|.  Reviews: Reitzer, L. (2005) &quot;Catabolism of Amino Acids and Related Compounds&quot; EcoSal 3.4.7 |CITS: [ecosal]| and |CITS: [12730324]|  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  As noted above, this pathway is considered to be the major route for threonine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  The first reaction in this pathway involves the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate (2-amino-3-ketobutyrate) catalyzed by the enzyme |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH). The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate is then converted to glycine by the enzyme |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|.  Glycine serves as the actual nitrogen donor in this pathway by its conversion to serine and the deamination of serine (see below). TDH is formed aerobically in cells grown in synthetic medium with glucose, and its activity is increased with L-leucine supplementation |CITS: [334738]|.  In contrast, the enzyme |FRAME: THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (TdcB, threonine deaminase (biodegradative)) which forms 2-oxobutanoate and ammonia under anaerobic conditions is involved in pathway |FRAME: PWY-5437|.  The product of the TDH reaction, 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate (2-amino-3-ketobutyrate) can also be nonenzymatically decarboxylated to aminoacetone as shown in pathway |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|.    The pathway shown here allows threonine utilization as a nitrogen source and as a carbon source and it also functions as a glycine source (see Reitzer review below).  It has also been characterized as an alternate pathway for serine biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [3108237]|.  Glycine produced in this pathway can be catabolized by the |FRAME: GLYCLEAV-PWY| as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, studies of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 using glycine as a sole nitrogen source suggested that glycine is converted to serine by the reversible |FRAME: GLYOHMETRANS-MONOMER|-catalyzed reaction (as shown in the reaction link) followed by serine deamination to produce pyruvate and ammonia |CITS: [764875][334738]| (see pathway |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Thus, during threonine catabolism, ammonia from serine acts as the nitrogen donor |CITS: [334738]|.  Although this pathway has been shown to be reversible &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, its &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; role is in threonine catabolism |CITS: [8407827]|.  Review: Reitzer, L.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and its phosphorylated derivative, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), are two of the most important coenzymes in redox reactions in the cell.  Generally, NAD is involved in catabolic reactions, while NADP is involved in anabolic reactions.  Because of the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring, the oxidized forms of these compounds are often depicted as NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.  Most oxidation reactions in cells are accomplished by the removal of hydrogen atoms.  In reactions where NAD or NADP participate, two hydrogen atoms are typically removed from the substrate.  During the reduction of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (or NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the molecule acquires two electrons and one proton, while the second proton is released into the medium.  Thus a typical reaction involving NAD is in the form:  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H -&gt; NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  NAD is synthesized via two major pathway families in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems; the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway, and the salvage pathway.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway, in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate |CITS: [11153263]|, while in eukaryotes, the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pathway starts with tryptophan |CITS: [12062417]| (|FRAME: NADSYN-PWY|).  The first attempt to elucidate a prokaryotic pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960 |CITS: [13731310]|. They implicated (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the synthesis of the pyridine ring of NAD in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Subsequent work by Chandler et al. |CITS: [4321550]| established that L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor.  Suzuki et al., in 1973, established that the three carbon precursor is dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and not glycerol |CITS: [4351074]|.  In addition, Andreoli et al. demonstrated that quinolinate was a key intermediate in this pathway |CITS: [14013029]|.  Eventually it became clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in this pathway, but in all known NAD biosynthetic pathways.  Reviews: |CITS: [11153263][12504674]| "/>

YehU forms a TCS with YehT - a LytTR-like response regulator which regulates expression of |FRAME: G7942-MONOMER &quot;&lt;i&gt;yjiY&lt;/i&gt;&quot;|, encoding an inner membrane transporter belonging to the CstA family of putative peptide transporters |CITS: [22685278], [24659770], [24225317]|. The YehUT system is activated at the onset of stationary phase during growth in media containing peptides and amino acids as carbon source |CITS: [22685278], [24659770]|. Activated YehUT has an negative effect on the expression of |FRAME: YHJX-MONOMER &quot;&lt;i&gt;yhjX&lt;/i&gt;&quot;| - the target of the YpdAB TCS |CITS: [24659770]|.   "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="|FRAME: Polymyxins Polymyxins| are antibiotics with a general structure consisting of a cyclic peptide with a long hydrophobic tail.  They are produced by the Gram-positive bacterium |FRAME:TAX-1406| and are selectively toxic for Gram-negative bacteria due to their specificity for the lipopolysaccharide molecules that exist within many Gram-negative outer membranes. Polymyxins disrupt the structure of the bacterial cell membrane by interacting with its phospholipids, and specifically with lipid A. Lipid A is negatively charged due to two phosphate groups, and the cationic polymyxin readily binds to it and induces cell death by permeabilizing the bacterial membrane.  Some Gram-negative bacteria, specifically Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, can become resistant to polymyxin by the modification of  their lipid A structure via the  attachment of 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinopyranose (L-Ara4N) groups to one or more phosphate groups |CITS: [17686460][18467098][19076233][19767429][ 21114395]|. This addition causes an absolute increase in lipid A charge, thus lowering the affinity of positively charged polymyxins |CITS: [18187325]|.  The modification of lipid A with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinopyranose (L-Ara4N) was first found in mutants of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; that are resistant to polymyxin |CITS: [7565089][11535605]|. However, the pathway for the synthesis of L-Ara4N and its transport and attachment to lipid A has been studied mostly in Salmonella.  The pathway is well understood up to the formation of |FRAME: CPD0-888| (UDP-Ara4FN). All steps up to this intermediate occur in the cytoplasm. UDP-Ara4FN is deformylated and transferred from the inner to the outer bacterial membrane by mechanisms that are not fully understood, although ArnE(PmrM) and ArnF(PmrL) may have a role in the transportation of UDP-Ara4FN across the bacterial inner membrane |CITS: [17928292]|. Once in the periplasm, LAra4N is transferred to lipid A by ArnT(PmrK) |CITS: [15939024][12045108][16226890]| .  The pathway is regulated by the |FRAME: PWY0-1482| (pmrA/pmrB). |FRAME: EG11615| is a response regulator that in its phosphorylated form can activate the genes that encode the proteins described in this pathway. Activation occurs either directly by Fe3+ ions |CITS: [11051552]|, or by a second two component system, the |FRAME: PWY0-1458|, which is activated by low Mg2+ concentration |CITS: [9371451]|.  The two systems are linked in Salmonella by the polymyxin resistance protein, |FRAME: G7172-MONOMER PmrD|. The PhoP-activated PmrD protects the phosphorylated response regulator PmrA from dephosphorylation, and promotes the transcription of PmrA-activated genes responsible for polymyxin resistance |CITS: [10775270]|. However, in E. coli PmrD does not protect the phosphorylated |FRAME: EG11615|. This may be the reason why E. coli fails to activate the pathway under low Mg2+ concentrations |CITS: [10373459]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="Synthesis of peptidoglycan in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 is a complex process which occurs across two cell compartments. This pathway describes the first stage of this process - the cytoplasmic synthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (a nucleotide activated monosaccharide-peptide) from the essential peptidoglycan precursor UDP-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&amp;alpha;-D-glucosamine.   The first reaction of this pathway, an &lt;i&gt;enol&lt;/i&gt;pyruvyl transfer from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to the C3-hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine, is catalysed by MurA |CITS: [1512209]|. The product of this reaction, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-enolpyruvate, is then reduced to UDP-N-acetyl-muramate (UDP-MurNAc) in a reaction catalysed by the NADPH dependent flavoprotein MurB |CITS: [8448160]|. The final 4 steps of the pathway result in attachment of a pentapeptide stem to the lactyl group of UDP-MurNAc to form a UDP-MurNAc-pentapeptide (specifically UDP-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&amp;alpha;-D-muramoyl-L-alanyl-&amp;gamma;-D-glutamyl-&lt;I&gt;meso&lt;/I&gt;-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine). The composition of the pentapeptide stem varies within bacterial species (see |CITS: [18194336]|); in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 the pentapeptide is formed by successive addition of L-alanine, D-glutamate, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-diaminopimelic acid (m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm) and a D-alanyl-alanine dipeptide catalysed by the MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF ligases respectively |CITS: [7601127][1765076][2269304][2186811]|. The pentapeptide stem contains several rare D-amino acids formed from their corresponding L-enantiomers through the action of amino acid racemases - alanine racemase I and II and glutamate racemase.   In a subsequent pathway (see |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|), the UDP-MurNAC-pentapeptide is transformed by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine and a lipid carrier molecule to form Lipid II (&lt;i&gt;ditrans,octacis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyldiphospho-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&amp;gamma;-D-glutamyl-&lt;I&gt;meso&lt;/I&gt;-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine) which is the monomer unit transported across the inner membrane for peptidoglycan maturation (described in |FRAME: PWY0-1586|).  The enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth and are thus attractive targets for antibacterial drug development (see for example reviews by |CITS: [12492849][17692001][21261855][21822642]|).

    <attribute name="description" value="In &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12, PhoRB is the two-component system for sensing and responding to variations in the level of extracellular inorganic phosphate (Pi). Pho RB regulates the expression of a large number of genes (the Pho regulon) which have a role in the assimilation of environmental Pi or the use of alternate Pi sources.  PhoR is the membrane associated sensor kinase which controls activity of the cytoplasmic response regulator and transcription factor PhoB. PhoR detects Pi only indirectly and its activity as a sensor kinase depends on its association with the phosphate transporter |FRAME: ABC-27-CPLX &quot;PstSCAB&quot;| and/or |FRAME: EG10735-MONOMER &quot;PhoU&quot;|. Accordingly signal transduction by Pi requires seven proteins (PhoR, PhoB, PstSCAB and PhoU) that interact in a membrane associated complex.   PhoRB signalling is believed to be a negative process - that is, activation of PhoB is the default state and excess environmental Pi is required to turn the system off. Under limiting environmental Pi, PhoR is believed to be in an active signalling conformation resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of PhoB and subsequent induction of the Pho regulon. Excess levels of Pi (&gt;4uM) result in an inhibited form of PhoR which interferes with phosphorylation of PhoB and prevents its activity as a transcription factor. The Pst transporter and the chaperone like protein PhoU are both necessary for inhibition of the PhoRB system.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Curcumin and other curcuminoids are plant secondary metabolites produced by &lt;i&gt;Curcuma longa&lt;/i&gt; (turmeric) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6432|).  Curcumin is the main yellow pigment of turmeric which is used as a spice and a pigment.  In addition, curcumin has a range of medicinal properties including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anticancer and analgesic.  Curcumin metabolism has been studied in humans and rodents and the production of reduced dihydro-, tetrahydro-, hexahydro- and octahydrocurcumin derivatives has been identified, with tetrahydrocurcumin and hexahydrocurcumin being the major products.  These reduced curcumin derivatives may then be conjugated to form glucuronides, sulfates, or mixed glucuronides/sulfates.  However, the mammalian enzymes and their encoding genes responsible for production of the reduced curcumin derivatives have not been identified.  Tetrahydrocurcumin has been shown to have more potent antioxidative activity than curcumin (in |CITS: [21467222]| and reviewed in |CITS: [17569222]|).  Intestinal microorganisms have also been shown to metabolize curcumin.  Curcumin metabolizing microorganisms were found in samples of human feces and the organism with the highest curcumin converting activity was isolated, cultured and identified as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;.  High curcumin converting activity was also identified in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 substr. DH10B whose genome sequence has been determined.  The curcumin metabolizing enzyme was purified from extracts of this organism and used to identify its encoding gene.  Following gene cloning and overexpression, the recombinant enzyme was purified and characterized.  The results showed that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; gene &lt;i&gt;yncB&lt;/i&gt; (annotated as predicted oxidoreductase, Zn-dependent and NAD(P)-binding) encoded the curcumin-converting enzyme and it was renamed &lt;i&gt;curA&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [21467222]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;   The purified product of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; gene &lt;i&gt;curA&lt;/i&gt; was shown to catalyze the NADPH-dependent, sequential reduction of curcumin first to the stable intermediate dihydrocurcumin, and then to the final end product tetrahydrocurcumin.  These compounds were identified by mass spectrometry techniques.  How curcumin enters the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cell and the fate of tetrahydrocurcumin in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is not yet known.  However, the optimum culture conditions for curcumin-converting enzyme formation in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 substr. DH10B included the use of 0.03% curcumin as the sole carbon source and 0.3% yeast extract as nitrogen source, suggesting further metabolism of curcumin under these conditions.  It has also been speculated that tetrahydrocurcumin produced by human or animal gut microorganisms may be used for various activities in the body |CITS: [21467222]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="Via this pathway &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is able to utilize either glycolate or glyoxylate as a sole source of carbon and energy.  Although &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has an alternate pathway to utilize glyoxylate (see |FRAME: GLYOXDEG-PWY|), this pathway is apparently essential for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to be able to grow on either of these two substrates because a mutational block in glyoxylate carboligase precludes growth on either substrate.  The other pathway (|FRAME: GLYOXDEG-PWY|) appears to play an ancillary role because a mutational block in its key enzyme (malate synthase G) has no detectable effect on the utilization of either substrate.  The essentiality of this pathway may reflect the fact that that it feeds into glycolysis and therefore becomes a source of acetyl-CoA, which is essential for the alternate pathway (|FRAME: GLYOXDEG-PWY|).  In addition to the utilization of exogenous glycolate and glyoxylate this pathway also allows &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to utilize endogenously generated glyoxylate as a by-product of purine metabolism and DNA repair.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Backround&lt;/b&gt;  The polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. While it is clear that polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, we still do not fully understand their specific molecular functions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; |CITS:[3157043]|. |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| and |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| are found in all life forms, and |FRAME:SPERMINE| is found mostly in eukaryotes.  |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| can be formed either directly from |FRAME:L-ORNITHINE| by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (see |FRAME:PWY-46|) or indirectly from |FRAME:ARG| by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (see |FRAME:PWY-40| and |FRAME:PWY-43|). While the ODC pathway was considered the only mammalian pathway for polyamine biosynthesis, recently the presence of the ADC pathway in mammals has been demonstrated |CITS:[11804860] [14738999]|. In higher plants the presence of both pathways has been known for some time |CITS: [11537482]|. In bacteria, both pathways are common, and are often found side by side in the same organism |CITS:[3157043]|.  There are two flavors of the ADC pathway. In both cases |FRAME:ARG| is first converted to |FRAME:AGMATHINE| by a biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase. However, in enterobacteria and mycobacteria |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is converted directly to |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| by the enzyme |FRAME:AGMATIN-CPLX| (this pathway), while in higher plants, &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; spp., &lt;i&gt;Aeromonas&lt;/i&gt; spp., and lactic bacteria, |FRAME:AGMATHINE| is first hydrolyzed by |FRAME:CPLX-31| into |FRAME:CPD-597| and |FRAME:AMMONIA|, and |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| is formed by removal of the ureido group from |FRAME:CPD-597| by the enzyme |FRAME:CPLX-39| (see pathway |FRAME:PWY-43|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway was studied mostly in enterobacteria, but it was also found in the mycobacteria |FRAME: TAX-1771| and |FRAME: TAX-1772| |CITS:[13192096]| and in the Gram positive bacterium |FRAME: TAX-1423| |CITS: [9723923]|. While |FRAME: TAX-83333| possesses both an ODC and an ADC pathways, in |FRAME: TAX-1423| this is the only |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| biosynthetic pathway. Remarkably, even though |FRAME:SPERMIDINE| is only synthesized in |FRAME: TAX-1423| via |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, no intracellular |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| was found in this organism |CITS:[9723923]|.  It should be mentioned that in some organisms, including |FRAME: TAX-83333|, this pathway can also operate in a catabolic manner |CITS:[3897201]|, catalyzing the degradation of |FRAME:ARG| through |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| into |FRAME:SUC| (see |FRAME:PWY0-823|). However, the main catabolic arginine pathway in these bacteria is the succinyltransferase pathway (|FRAME:AST-PWY|). Interestingly, unlike |FRAME: TAX-83333|, wild-type &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains are unable to use |FRAME:ARG| as a carbon source, even though they can use it as a nitrogen source |CITS:[3534538]|.  |FRAME: TAX-83333| has two forms of the enzyme arginine decarboxylase: a constitutive, biosynthetic form, encoded by the |FRAME:EG10959| gene, and an inducible catabolic form, encoded by the |FRAME:EG11501| gene. When the cataolic form is not expressed, the pathway operates only in an anabolic manner, catalyzing the biosynthesis of |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, which is used by the bacteria either directly or as a precursor for the biosynthesis of other polyamines (see |FRAME:POLYAMSYN-PWY|). However, when the cells are grown in an arginine-rich medium, especially if the medium is acidic and conditions are semi-anaerobic, the catabolic arginine decarboxylase is expressed, and the pathway operates in a catabolic manner, feeding |FRAME:PUTRESCINE| via |FRAME:4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| and |FRAME:SUC| into the |FRAME:TCA| |CITS:[3157043]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Polyamines (the most common of which are putrescine, spermidine and spermine) are a group of positively charged organic polycations that are involved in many biological processes including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|.  Putrescine and spermidine are found in all domains of life and are the major polyamines in bacteria.  Spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes.  While polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, their specific molecular functions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remain poorly understood |CITS:[3157043]|.  Polyamines have been proposed to stimulate cell growth in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; through stimulation of protein synthesis (reviewed in |CITS: [16428314]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; deletion of all genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis resulted in a 40-50% reduced growth rate in amine-free medium under aerobic conditions, although polyamines were required for growth of this strain under strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS: [19542271]|.    Putrescine can be formed either directly from L-ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) (this pathway) or indirectly from L-arginine by arginine decarboxylase (ADC) (see pathway |FRAME:PWY-40| which is also found in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, and |FRAME:PWY-43| found in other bacteria and plants).  Both the ODC and ADC pathways have been demonstrated in mammals |CITS:[11804860] [14738999]| and higher plants |CITS: [11537482]|.  In bacteria the ODC and ADC pathways are common and are often found in the same organism (|CITS:[3157043]| and reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).  Enteric bacteria possess two forms of ornithine decarboxylase, a biosynthetic (constitutive) form shown in this pathway which is  apparently present in all strains of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, and a biodegradative (inducible) form (see |FRAME:ORNDECARBOXDEG-CPLX|) which is present in some strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [3157043] [1939141]|.  Other bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; appear to have only a single ornithine decarboxylase which is regulated in a complex manner to ensure proper expression for both polyamine biosynthesis and degradation.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  L-ornithine can be decarboxylated to putrescine for two purposes, either anabolically for the generation of putrescine itself and putrescine as a precursor of spermidine (this pathway), or catabolically as a carbon and nitrogen source.  In the anabolic ODC pathway shown here putrescine is generated from L-ornithine in a single reaction by the biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;speC&lt;/i&gt;.  Experiments have demonstrated that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 cells can take up radiolabeled ornithine and convert to putrescine via this pathway |CITS: [5330264]|.  In the catabolic ODC pathway shown in |FRAME:ORNDEG-PWY| putrescine is generated in the first reaction by the degradative ornithine decarboxylase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;speF&lt;/i&gt;.  Biosynthetic ornithine decarboxylase is inhibited by both putrescine and spermidine, and is activated by GTP and other nucleotides |CITS: [4370496]|.  The synthetic compound difluoromethylornithine is an irreversible inhibitor of most ornithine decarboxylases |CITS:[6421528]| although the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme is not inhibited by this compound |CITS:[6800359]|.  As indicated in the pathway link, spermidine is biosynthesized from putrescine and decarboxylated &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosylmethionine in a reaction catalyzed by the product of gene &lt;i&gt;speE&lt;/i&gt; (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes and are determinants of intracellular communication, in the form of lipid second messengers |CITS: [11094259]|, and fatty acyl moieties of proteins that modify their location and function |CITS: [10446384]|.  There are two basic types of fatty acid (FAS) biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the |FRAME: TAX-5794| phylum |CITS: [17112527]| and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of a holo-[acp].  The best-studied pathway is that of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized |CITS: [15952903]|.  Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs|, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequnce, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, and this pathway describes the major route. In it, one acetyl-CoA molecule is converted to malonyl-CoA, which is then activated to malonyl-ACP that is condensed with a second acetyl-CoA molecule to form acetoacetyl-ACP.  The first enzyme in this pathway, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, is the controlling point for the flux of carbon into lipids. It is a biotin-containing multi-enzyme complex with two activities, |FRAME: BIOTIN-CARBOXYL-CPLX| and |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLTRANSFER-CPLX|, catalyzing two half reactions that combined condense bicarbonate with acetyl-CoA to yield malonyl-CoA. Further discussion of this enzyme is available in the pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1264|.  The malonyl-CoA is next attached to a holo-[acp] by the enzyme malonyl-CoA-ACP transacylase.  The last step of the pathway, the condensation of a second acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP, is carried out by the condensing enzyme &amp;beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthase (KAS). &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has three &amp;beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases: KASI, KASII and KASIII encoded by &lt;i&gt;fabB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fabF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fabH&lt;/i&gt; respectively.   KASIII is the key enzyme in the initiation of fatty acids biosynthesis. It selectively catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-ACP and specifically uses CoA thioesters rather than acyl-ACP as the primer. The products tend to be shorter than the products of KASI and II, which are involved primarily in elongation reactions. Unlike the other two enzymes, KASIII cannot participate in the terminal elongation steps of fatty acid biosynthesis |CITS: [15952903]|.  KASIII is inhibited by long-chain acyl-ACPs, indicating a role in feedback regulation of fatty acid synthesis. Since it catalyzes the first condensation step in fatty acid synthesis, it is able to control the rate of fatty acid initiation.  The substrate specificity of KASIII is a major determining factor in membrane fatty acid composition of an organism. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the enzyme is highly selective for acetyl-CoA, and thus only straight-chain fatty acids are produced in this organism. |CITS:[10629181]|.  Other potential routes for fatty acid biosynthesis initiation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 are described in |FRAME: PWY-5966| and |FRAME: PWY-5965|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="Heme (protoheme, heme &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins.  It is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. It is biosynthesized as protoheme, but different derivatives of protoheme can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including how it is bound to the protein, such as |FRAME: HEME_O|, |FRAME: HEME_A|, |FRAME: HEME_C|, and |FRAME: HEME_D|.  This superpathway shows the two routes of synthesis found in the facultative anaerobe E. coli. Under aerobic conditions, the transition from |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN| is catalyzed by the oxygen -dependent |FRAME: COPROGENOXI-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.3.3). However, when oxygen is not available, the organism is still able to catalyze this transition, using the readical-SAM enzyme |FRAME: HEMN-MONOMER| (EC 1.3.99.22), which can catalyze the transition without the need for molecular oxygen. This enzyme, which contains an iron-sulfur cluster, is able to break SAM into |FRAME: MET| and a 5'-deoxyadenosineyl radical. This radical can attack |FRAME: COPROPORPHYRINOGEN_III| and bring about the conversion to |FRAME: PROTOPORPHYRINOGEN|.  This enzyme is found in many bacteria, but does not appear to be present in archaea or eukarya (the only reference for the enzyme in a eukaryote is in the organism |FRAME: TAX-5911|, but this finding is based on sequence analysis alone, and has not been verified biochemically).  Important branch points within this pathway lead to biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin) (see |FRAME: P381-PWY|), |FRAME: CPD-7425| (see |FRAME: PWY-5196|), |FRAME: SIROHEME| (see |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D biosynthesis, and bacteriochlorophyll (see |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|)."/>

Both free bases and nucleosides can be imported into the cell by specialized transporters |CITS:[8982282][22616996][22857534]|. On the other hand, nucleotides (which are phosphorylated) can not be imported due to their negative charge, and thus can not be salvaged from the environment.  Any of the pyrimidine bases and pyrimidine nucleosides can in theory serve as a total source of pyrimidine for ribonucleoside triphosphates biosynthesis (and subsequently for deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates synthesis).

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  |FRAME:ALLANTOIN &quot;Allantoin&quot;| is a common product of purine degradation.  Allantoin is rich in nitrogen, and many organisms are able to degrade and recycle it.  Some bacteria, including |FRAME: TAX-1458|, |FRAME: TAX-80866| and |FRAME: TAX-264198|, do so under aerobic conditions, while others such as |FRAME: TAX-83333|, |FRAME: ORG-5985| and |FRAME: TAX-587| do so only anaerobically.  Allantoin degradation is not limited to bacteria.  Ureide-transporting plants convert fixed nitrogen in their roots to |FRAME:ALLANTOIN| and |FRAME: ALLANTOATE|, which are then transported to upper parts of the plant, where they are degraded to release the nitrogen.  In addition, some fungi and animals also degrade allantoin.  The first step of the pathway, catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX-64|, comprises the hydrolysis of the internal amide bond of |FRAME: S-ALLANTOIN|, forming |FRAME: ALLANTOATE| |CITS: [786256]|.  This enzyme turned out to be common to all organisms that can degrade allantoin, and is the first step in all allantoin degradation pathways.  |FRAME: ALLANTOATE &quot;Allantoate&quot;| is converted to |FRAME: CPD0-2298| via one of two routes.  In the first route, the nitrogen is liberated in a single step in the form of |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: ALLANTOICASE-RXN &quot;EC 3.5.3.4&quot;|), while in the other route it is liberated in the form of |FRAME: AMMONIA| in two steps, via the intermediate |FRAME: CPD0-2298| (starting with |FRAME: ALLANTOATE-DEIMINASE-RXN &quot;EC 3.5.3.9&quot;|).  The next step in the pathway is the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-1091| to |FRAME: GLYOX|.  Similarly, this conversion can proceed with the liberation of either |FRAME: UREA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-LYASE-RXN &quot;EC 4.3.2.3&quot;|) or |FRAME: AMMONIA| (|FRAME: UREIDOGLYCOLATE-HYDROLASE-RXN &quot;EC 3.5.3.19&quot;|).  Several combinations of these routes have been documented.  Some organisms possess pathways that produce solely |FRAME: UREA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5694|), some produce only |FRAME: AMMONIA| (see |FRAME: PWY-5692|), and some produce both (see |FRAME: PWY-5705|).  In addition, some anaerobic organisms can degrade allantoin to |FRAME: CPD-389| instead of |FRAME: GLYOX| (see |FRAME: PWY0-41|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In this hybrid pathway |FRAME: CPLX-7524| and |FRAME: G6284-MONOMER| catalyze the first two deamination steps, producing |FRAME: CPD-1091| and |FRAME: AMMONIA|, while |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| gives rise to |FRAME:GLYOX| and |FRAME: UREA|.  Glyoxylate could then enter general metabolism, where it would be converted by the successive action of three enzymes to 3-phosphoglycerate, feeding into |FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS| (see |FRAME: GLYCOLATEMET-PWY|).  However, this route would imply that allantoin &lt;b&gt;can&lt;/b&gt; serve as a sole source of carbon for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, which it can not.  It has been speculated that this pathway is not utilized in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; due to the low expression of |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| |CITS: [19935661]|.  Additionally, |FRAME: G6275-MONOMER| is poorly characterized.   "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="|FRAME: BIOTIN &quot;Biotin&quot;| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.   Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years.  The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [20693992]|.  Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure.  The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety.  The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.  The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are known from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR analysis of products labeled &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|.  The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate.  The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|.  As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.  The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicated in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.  Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|.  An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]| and later refined.  Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 &quot;BioC&quot;| converts the free carboxyl group of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [22965231]|.  The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: Malonyl-acp-methyl-ester| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters &quot;pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester&quot;|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 &quot;BioH&quot;| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs &quot;pimeloyl-[acp]&quot;|.  The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 &quot;BioF&quot;|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.  The next step in the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|.  The product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|.  This enzyme catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.  The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|.  This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.  It has not been possible to reconstitute a catalytic reaction of this enzyme &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and there is some uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanism, cofactor requirements, and the source of the sulfur atom |CITS: [15850974]|.  However, recent experiments have suggested that a |FRAME: CPD-6| of the enzyme is the source of the sulfur atom.  Consistent with its proposed role as the sulfur donor, degradation of the [2Fe-2S] cluster |CITS: [14967042]| as well as exchange of sulfur atoms between the [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters |CITS: [16533066]| is observed during turnover of the enzyme.  According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.  An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Iron is an essential trace element. In the presence of oxygen, ferrous iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is oxidized to ferric iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) which forms insoluble compounds that are not available to bacteria. As a result, the level of physiologically available iron can drop to low levels and become growth-limiting. To survive, many bacteria evolved specialized transport systems for low molecular weight iron chelating compounds called siderophores which form complexes with Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Amino acid conjugates of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate make up a major class of siderophores, including enterobactin, bacillibactin and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylglycine.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; produces only one siderophore, enterobactin which is a cyclic triester of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine. It is transported by the |FRAME: EG10293-MONOMER| which imports Fe3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; chelated to enterobactin into the cell. Enterobactin biosynthesis in unnecessary under anaerobic conditions when iron is in the soluble Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; form.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  As indicated in the first the pathway link, 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is synthesized from chorismate via isochorismate and 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydrobenzoate. Chorismate is a key intermediate and branch point in the biosynthesis of many aromatic compounds. As shown in the second pathway link, three molecules of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate are combined with three molecules of L-serine by the |FRAME: ENTMULTI-CPLX| to form enterobactin. Isochorismate is both a precursor of enterobactin via isochorismate synthase EntC, and a precursor of menaquinol-8 via isochorismate synthase MenF. Menaquinol-8 is required under anaerobic conditions (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5837| and subsequent pathway links).  The biosynthesis of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate from chorismate is catalyzed by three enzymes EntC, EntB, and EntA. EntC catalyzes the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate. The N-terminal isochorismate lyase domain of EntB hydrolyzes the pyruvate group of isochorismate to produce 2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoate. The conversion of this latter compound to 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate is catalyzed by the EntA dehydrogenase.  Gene &lt;i&gt;ryhB&lt;/i&gt; encodes a small RNA that promotes enterobactin biosynthesis via posttranscriptional mechanisms. It is required for normal expression of the &lt;i&gt;entCEBAH&lt;/i&gt; transcription unit, and it also represses translation of the &lt;i&gt;cysE&lt;/i&gt; encoded |FRAME: CPLX0-237| thereby allowing L-serine to be used in enterobactin biosynthesis |CITS: [20696910]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Coenzyme A (CoA) is an essential and ubiquitous cofactor occurring in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.  It is utilized both as a source of the phosphopantetheine moiety of certain proteins and as a carrier in a large number of reactions central to intermediary metabolism.  CoA is the acyl carrier required for reactions in both biosynthetic and degradative pathways, forming derivatives that are key intermediates in energy metabolism.  The biosynthesis of CoA was recognized as a target for antibacterial drug discovery.  Interest in the human pathway was sparked by the association of a neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in pantothenate kinase.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Pantothenate is the starting compound for the biosynthesis of CoA.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can synthesize pantothenate via the |FRAME: PANTO-PWY| pathway or import it from the medium via the |FRAME: PANF-MONOMER|.  Five enzymatic steps then convert pantothenate to CoA.   Pantothenate kinase first phosphorylates pantothenate to 4'-phosphopantothenate; the enzyme is feedback inhibited by CoA itself, accounting for the primary regulatory mechanism of CoA biosynthesis.  The addition of cysteine, resulting in the formation of (R)-4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC), and the subsequent decarboxylation of PPC to 4'-phosphopantetheine, are catalyzed by a bifunctional enzyme.  The enzymatic activities can be separated, and indeed exist as two separately encoded enzymes in other organisms.  Phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase and dephospho-CoA kinase finally convert 4'-phosphopantetheine to CoA.  All enzymes of this pathway are essential for growth of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.

Degradation can proceed by different mechanisms:  Unmodified trehalose may be degraded by a hydrolyzing trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182| and |FRAME: PWY0-1466|), or it may be split by the action of a trehalose phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2722| and |FRAME: PWY-2723|).  Likewise, trehalose-6-phosphate may be either hydrolyzed by trehalose-6-phosphate hydrolase (see |FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) or it could be attacked by a trehalose-6-phosphate phosphorylase (see |FRAME: PWY-2721|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Trehalase enzymes of the GH37 family of glycoside hydrolases hydrolyze a molecule of |FRAME: TREHALOSE| into two molecules of glucose with inversion of the anomeric configuration.   &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can grow with trehalose as the sole carbon source, and employs different pathways for its degradation under different osmolarity conditions.  Under conditions of high osmolarity, the PTS pathway for uptake of trehalose (|FRAME: TREDEGLOW-PWY|) is blocked.  The |FRAME: TREHALAPERI-MONOMER| (TreA) provides the cell the ability to utilize trehalose under those conditions |CITS: [2671658]|.  External trehalose is hydrolyzed by TreA into two molecules of glucose |CITS: [2820965]|, which are then transported into the cytoplasm through the glucose PTS |CITS: [1825082]|.  TreA also has a second function: under high osmotic conditions, the bacterium synthesizes large amounts of trehalose to be used as an osmoprotectant.  TreA recycles trehalose molecules that leak from the cytoplasm into the periplasm |CITS: [3131312]|.  Another pathway that utilizes a cytoplasmic trehalase is active during the transition period between high and low osmolarity (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|)."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved as a catabolic anaerobic pathway that fulfills two essential functions:   i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and  ii) it is an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism) because it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.  Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites. This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Glucose is not shown here as a component of glycolysis because when used by &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; as a source of carbon and energy, glucose enters the cell via a phosphotransferase system (transport of glucose, |FRAME: CPLX-157|), the first intracellular species, therefore, being glucose-6-phosphate. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; does constitutively produce |FRAME:GLUCOKIN-MONOMER| (the intracellular enzyme that converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate) but it is not needed for the utilization of either exogenous or endogenous glucose |CITS: [9023215]|. Under anabolic stress conditions, it may be required to supplement levels of glucose 6-phosphate |CITS: [7786044]|.  For reviews, please see:  Romeo, T. and J. L.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The name trehalose was introduced in 1858 to describe a main constituent of shells that are secreted by various insects on tree leaves in the middle east.  These shells were often dried and used as a sweetening agent, and are believed to be related to the biblical Manna, the food supplied to the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness of Arabia.  One variety of these shells, produced by the beetles &lt;i&gt;Larinus maculatus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Larinus nidificans&lt;/i&gt;, was called &quot;trehala manna&quot;, and the sugar extracted from it was named trehalique glucose, or trehalose |CITS: [12065209]|.  In fact, trehalose is a disaccharide that is ubiquitous in the biosphere.  It consists of two subunits of glucose bound by an &amp;alpha;:1-1 linkage (&amp;alpha;-D-glucopyranosyl &amp;alpha;-D-glucopyranoside) and is thus nonreducing.  Trehalose has been isolated and characterized from many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, insects and mammals |CITS: [11081789]| (and original references described therein).   In addition to being nonreducing, trehalose possesses several unique properties, including high hydrophilicity, chemical stability, nonhygroscopic glass formation and no internal hydrogen bond formation.  The combination of these features explains the principal role of trehalose as a stress metabolite.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Under conditions of elevated osmotic strength, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can regulate the osmotic strength of the cytoplasm by accumulating K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and some organic molecules, commonly called osmoprotectants or compatible solutes.  The preferred osmoprotectant of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is glycine betaine.  However, its synthesis relies on an external supply of proline, betaines, or choline.  When these compounds are not available, a cell can achieve a moderate level of osmotic tolerance by accumulation of glutamate and trehalose |CITS: [1825082]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes and accumulates trehalose when exposed to osmotic stress |CITS: [2883950]| and low temperatures |CITS: [12105274]|.  It is synthesized from UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate via trehalose-6-phosphate, by the action of two enzymes, trehalose-6-phosphate synthase and trehalose-6-phosphate phosphatase.  Expression of both genes encoding the two enzymes, &lt;i&gt;otsA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;otsB&lt;/i&gt;, is osmotically regulated.  Transcription from these genes increases during osmotic stress |CITS: [3131312]| and cold shock |CITS: [12105274]| and when the cells enter stationary phase, and requires the stress sigma factor RpoS |CITS: [1744047]|.  Synthesis of trehalose is also stimulated directly by K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion-dependent activation of trehalose-6-phosphate synthase enzyme |CITS: [3131312]|.  Under osmotic stress, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; overproduces trehalose, some of which is excreted to the periplasmic space.  Once there, it is degraded by the periplasmic trehalase (see |FRAME: PWY0-1182|).  This process was named &quot;a futile cycle for controlling the cytoplasmic level of trehalose&quot; |CITS: [1825082]|.  Reviews: |CITS: [8391102][12626396][23302511]| "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via dihydroxyacetone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone) and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone).  Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review).  There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds.  These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the glutathione-dependent glyoxalase system is probably the most common pathway that catalyzes the conversion of methylglyoxal to a less toxic product.  In the pathway shown here, methylglyoxal is converted to (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-lactate via the intermediate (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-lactoyl-glutathione by two glyoxylase enzymes.  |FRAME: GLYOXI-CPLX| (GloA) isomerizes the hemithioacetal that is formed non-enzymatically from methylglyoxal and glutathione to (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-lactoyl-glutathione.  Glyoxalase II enzymes, mainly |FRAME: GLYOXII-MONOMER GloB| with a minor contribution from |FRAME: G6475-MONOMER GloC|, hydrolyze the thioester to (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-lactate, regenerating the glutathione in the process |CITS: [25670698]|.  In addition, |FRAME: CPLX0-3954 YeiG| can catalyze the hydrolysis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-lactoylglutathione and may also be involved in the detoxification of endogenous methylglyoxal |CITS: [16567800]|.  This system not only involves the enzymes encoded by the unlinked genes &lt;i&gt;gloA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;gloB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;gloC&lt;/i&gt;, but also their integration with the glutathione adduct-gated |FRAME: KEFB-MONOMER &quot;KefGB K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux system&quot;|.  Studies of a &amp;Delta;&lt;i&gt;gloB&lt;/i&gt; mutant supported a model that includes activation of KefGB by &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-lactoylglutathione resulting in K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; efflux and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx.  This lowering of cytoplasmic pH also protects against methylglyoxal damage |CITS: [21143325]|.   The fate of (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;)-lactate is less well characterized.  It can be excreted or further metabolized |CITS: [21143325]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="The pathway of cysteine biosynthesis is a two-step conversion starting from L-serine and yielding L-cysteine.  This pathway is regulated at the genetic level in its second step, wtih both cysteine synthase isozymes being under the positive control of the cysteine-responsive transcription factor CysB. It is also subject to very strong feedback inhibition of its first step by the final pathway product, cysteine.  Although two cysteine synthase isozymes exist, only cysteine synthase A (CysK) forms a complex with serine acetyltransferase. CysK is also the only one of the two cysteine synthases that is required for cell viability on cysteine-free medium.  Both steps in this pathway are reversible. Based on genetic and proteomic data, it appears that the cysteine synthases may actually act as a sulfur scavenging system during sulfur starvation, stripping sulfur off of L-cysteine, generating any number of variant amino acids in the process."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="This multi-enzyme complex, which consists of 24 subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase, 24 subunits of lipoate acetyltransferase, and 12 subunits of dihydrolipoate dehydrogenase, catalyzes three reactions, which constitute a cycle.  The complex contains a lipoyl active site in the form of lipoyllysine, as well as a thiamin diphosphate.   The net consequence of the cycle, in addition to reducing NAD+, is the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, a key reaction of central metabolism because it links glycolysis I, which generates pyruvate, to the TCA cycle, into which the acetyl-CoA flows.  During aerobic growth the cycle is an essential source of acetyl-CoA to feed the TCA cycle and thereby to satisfy the cellular requirements for the precursor metabolites it forms.  Mutant strains defective in the complex require an exogenous source of acetate to meet this requirement, but anaerobically such mutants grow without exogenous acetate because under such conditions, pyruvate formate lyase generates acetyl-CoA from pyruvate.  Mutant strains lacking pyruvate formate lyase have the reverse phenotype.  They require acetate for anaerobic but not for aerobic growth.   Review: Clark, D.P. and John E. Cronan.

The enzyme can also catalyze  conversion of lactose to allolactose (&amp;beta;-D-galactopyranosyl-(1-6)-D-glucopyranose) by transglycosylation,  and can hydrolyze allolactose (in |CITS: [6767683]|).  Allolactose is the physiological inducer of this pathway.    Further metabolism of glucose and galactose inside the cell is thought to proceed by their initial transport out of the  cell, followed by reentry.  It has been shown that when lactose is added to a growing culture of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;,  galactose, glucose and allolactose reach high levels inside the cells and are rapidly effluxed into the medium  |CITS: [6767683]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers.  This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression as a function of cell density.  Many processes benefit from community cooperation, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development.  One of the paradigms of quorum sensing is that the signaling molecule accumulates in the extracellular medium.  However, some bacteria, including &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, can take up and degrade the autoinducer AI-2.  The role of this process in the context of its natural multi-organism habitat is not fully understood yet.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The AI-2 degradation pathway has been elucidated in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  The expression of transmembrane transporter proteins and degradation enzymes is regulated by the presence of AI-2.  After uptake, AI-2 kinase phosphorylates AI-2 to 5-phospho-AI-2.  This product then undergoes isomerization to P-HPD, followed by transfer of an acetyl group to coenzyme A and release of dihydroxyacetone phosphate.  Notably, both end products are intermediates in central carbon metabolism.  In fact, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can utilize AI-2 as the sole source of carbon and energy, although very poorly compared to carbon sources such as glucose and ribose.

    <attribute name="description" value="|FRAME: BIOTIN &quot;Biotin&quot;| is an essential cofactor for carboxyl group transfer enzymes such as |FRAME: ACETYL-COA-CARBOXYLMULTI-CPLX|, and is required by all forms of life |CITS: [ColiSalII]|.   Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years.  The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [20693992]|.  Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure.  The early steps of the pathway, which are described here, describe the synthesis of the precursor of the pimelate moiety.  The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described in |FRAME: PWY0-1507|.  The origins of the biotin carbon atoms in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are known from &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR analysis of products labeled &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [8125118][Indrajit94]|.  The C3, C5 and C7 carbons are derived from carbon C1 of acetate, while the C2, C4 and C6 carbons are derived from carbon C2 of acetate.  The C1 carbon originates from |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE|.  This labeling pattern indicated that the pimeloyl moiety of biotin is formed by head-to-tail incorporation of three intact acetate units, similar to the synthesis of fatty acids |CITS: [Indrajit94]|.  As the biotin C1 and C7 atoms show different labeling patterns, free pimelic acid (a symmetrical molecule) could not be an intermediate, and thus it has been assumed that |FRAME: CPD-558| is the precursor |CITS: [Webb07]|.  The elucidation of the pathway proved difficult, mostly since only two genes, |FRAME: EG10119| and |FRAME: EG10122|, were implicated in the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety |CITS: [4563978][8830257][4877129]|.  Based on these finding, there have been several suggestions that enzymes of the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway are involved, although none of these suggestions could explain the full process |CITS: [Indrajit94][13930373]|.  An inclusive model was finally suggested in 2010 |CITS: [20693992]| and later refined.  Based on this model, |FRAME: EG10119 &quot;BioC&quot;| converts the free carboxyl group of |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP| to its methyl ester by transfer of a methyl group from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| |CITS: [22965231]|.  The newly acquired methyl group mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains, and enables the esterified |FRAME: Malonyl-acp-methyl-ester| to enter the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  Two reiterations of the fatty acid elongation cycle (see |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|) produce |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACP-methyl-esters &quot;pimeloyl-[acp] methyl ester&quot;|, which is cleaved by |FRAME: EG10122 &quot;BioH&quot;| to give |FRAME: Pimeloyl-ACPs &quot;pimeloyl-[acp]&quot;|.  The [acp] protein is then removed in a complex reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: EG10121 &quot;BioF&quot;|, forming |FRAME: 8-AMINO-7-OXONONANOATE|, the first intermediate in biotin ring assembly.  According to this model, the introduction of the methyl ester early in the pathway disguises the biotin synthetic intermediates so that they become substrates for the fatty acid synthetic pathway.  When the synthesis of the pimeloyl moiety is complete and disguise is no longer needed, the methyl group is removed to free the carboxyl group that will eventually be used to attach biotin to its target metabolic enzymes.  An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; system that uses dialyzed cell extracts was used in combination with several mutant strains and purified proteins to verify the proposed pathway |CITS: [20693992]|."/>

The degradation of the phenylpropanoids &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate, 3-phenylpropionate (3-phenylpropanoate) and their hydroxylated derivatives has been reported in several members of the Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria |CITS: [5881653][3777934][4348920][9324265]| including &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 and other strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [6345502]|. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 this pathway is one of only two aromatic-ring-cleavage pathways that are found in the organism.  The other aromatic-ring-cleavage pathway is |FRAME: PWY0-321|.   &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The &lt;i&gt;mhp&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;hca&lt;/i&gt; encoded enzymes of the pathway shown here can metabolize both &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate and its hydroxylated derivatives, and 3-phenylpropionate and its hydroxylated derivatives (as shown in pathway |FRAME: HCAMHPDEG-PWY|).  In these pathways 2,3-dihydroxy-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate and  3-(2,3-dihydroxyphenyl)propionate undergo ring cleavage by the &lt;i&gt;meta&lt;/i&gt;-cleaving dioxygenase MhpB |CITS: [9603882]|.  This pathway ultimately yields fumarate and 2-oxopent-4-enoate, which is further degraded to pyruvate and acetyl-CoA as described in the linked pathway |FRAME: PWY-5162|. This pathway, including the portion that is described in |FRAME: PWY-5162|, has eight steps, making it one of the longest catabolic sequences known in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [3531186][8399388][9098055]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 can grow on 3-phenylpropionate, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, or 3-hydroxy-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate as sole source of carbon and energy. It cannot grow on &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-cinnamate for unknown reasons, although whole cells can readily oxidize this compound after growth with 3-phenylpropionate |CITS: [6345502][9603882]|.  The fact that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can degrade aromatic acids suggests a wider natural distribution for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; than the anaerobic environment of the animal gut |CITS: [6345502]|. As a facultative anaerobe, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; must be able to survive and grow in habitats such as soil, water and food, during interhost transfer.  Review:  |CITS: [11729263]|"/>

    <attribute name="description" value="The pathways of biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine are intimately connected.  The first step of both pathways is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; the third step of both is the conversion of a ketoacid to an aminoacid through transamination.  The two pathways differ only in the second step of their three-step reaction sequences:  In the case of phenylalanine biosynthesis a dehydratase converts prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a reaction that occurs slowly in the absence of enzymic acitivity); in the case of tyrosine biosynthesis, a dehydrogenase converts prephenate to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  Also in both pathways the first two steps are catalyzed by two distinct active sites on a single protein.  Thus the first step of each pathway can be catalyzed by two enzymes: those associated with both the phenylalanine-specific dehydratase and the tyrosine-specific dehydrogenase.  Three enzymes, those encoded by &lt;i&gt;tyrB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;aspC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt;, are involved in catalyzing the third step of these pathways: all three can contribute to the synthesis of phenylalanine; only TyrB and AspC contribute to the biosynthesis of tyrosine.  Under normal physiological conditions, TyrB is the primary enzyme contributing to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  AspC contributes to their synthesis when substrate pools are large.  The contribution of the &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt;-encoded enzyme to phenylalanine biosynthesis was demonstrated in triple mutants of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 that lacked all three aminotransferases and required both phenylalanine and tyrosine for growth.  However, &lt;i&gt;tyrB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;aspC&lt;/i&gt; double mutants required only tyrosine for growth |CITS: [15983]|.  This suggested a role for IlvE in phenylalanine biosynthesis in the &lt;i&gt;tyrB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;aspC&lt;/i&gt; double mutants, although its role in strains with functional TyrB and AspC is unknown.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The distinction between nucleoside degradation and salvage is not always straightforward.  A general rule is that degradation pathways start with the nucleotide forms and convert them to simpler forms, eventually leading to complete mineralization, while salvage pathways start with either the nucleoside or the free base form, and convert those to the nucleotide forms.    Nucleotide recycling is achieved by a combination of both types of pathways - a nucleotide is partially degraded via a degradation pathway, but the products are shuttled into a salvage pathway rather then towards complete mineralization.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway begins with the nucleotide GMP which can be hydrolyzed by several enzymes to the nucleoside guanosine.  Guanosine is converted to the free base guanine by the phosphorylases DeoD or XapA (EC 2.4.2.1), which also participate in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6620|.  However, the salvage pathway ends with the nucleotide GMP from which other guanosine nucleotides are biosynthesized, while this degradation pathway ends with urate.  Guanine is converted to urate via xanthine by the enzymes guanine deaminase and a putative xanthine oxidase |CITS: [10986234]|.  In most organisms urate is degraded further, providing the organism with carbon, nitrogen and energy.  However, this does not appear to be the case in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Although radiolabeled carbon experiments have indicated the presence of a uricase activity that catalyzes the degradation of urate to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allantoin, no such enzyme has been characterized in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Xanthine degradation does not progress past &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-allantoin or allantoate and this catabolism does not suffice as a source of nitrogen under aerobic growth conditions |CITS: [10986234]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Cell-to-cell communication in bacteria is accomplished through the exchange of extracellular signaling molecules called autoinducers. This process, termed quorum sensing, allows bacterial populations to coordinate gene expression as a function of cell density. Many processes benefit from community cooperation, including bioluminescence, virulence factor expression, antibiotic production and biofilm development.  Cell to cell signaling through quorum sensing in bacteria occurs through three main processes LuxR-LuxI, LuxS/AI-2, and AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine.  The LuxR-LuxI process controls signaling through autoinducer 1 (AI-1) which is an &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL).  It was first described in &lt;i&gt;Vibrio fischeri&lt;/i&gt; as a regulator of bioluminescence.  However &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; lack LuxI and do not synthesize AHLs, although the product of gene &lt;i&gt;sdiA&lt;/i&gt; recognizes AHLs from other bacterial species.  The LuxS/AI-2 process controls both intraspecies and interspecies signaling.  It was first described as an extracellular signal produced by the marine bacterium &lt;i&gt;Vibrio harveyi&lt;/i&gt; to control luciferase expression |CITS: [7984107][9990077]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; AI-2 activates transcription of the &lt;i&gt;lsr&lt;/i&gt; operon encoding an ABC transporter, the LsrB subunit of which binds AI-2 (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).  The AI-3/epinephrine/norepinephrine process involves recognition by gut commensals of autoinducer produced by self, other bacteria, or human hormones.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; AI-3 interacts with a membrane-bound protein QseC which is part of the QseB-QseC two component system.  AI-2 production depends upon growth conditions.  Factors include nutrients, pH, osmolarity, oxygen, growth rate and stress factors.  However, its exact role in cell signaling is still controversial and there is evidence that its function may be metabolic |CITS: [16352847][16385049][16321939]|.  A role for AI-2 in pathogenesis also remains to be established although transcriptomics studies have suggested that AI-2 may have a role in the regulation of virulence in enterohemorrhagic &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [18256823]|. The &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; AI-2 network has also been the subject of different modeling approaches |CITS: [19695305][17170762]|.   Review: Kendall, M.M. and V. Sperandio (2009) &quot;Cell-to-Cell Signaling in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt;.&quot; EcoSal 5.5 |CITS: [ecosal]|  Reviews: |CITS: [17869606][16487745][16459080][15864263][15908344]|      &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  One of the main bacterial autoinducers is autoinducer 2 (AI-2) which mediates the quorum sensing 2 (QS-2) system.  Its biosynthesis is catalyzed by the LuxS enzyme which also participates in the SAM cycle (see |FRAME: PWY-6151|). The LuxS enzyme is found in many bacteria including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;.  Its role in AI-2 biosynthesis is suggested by the presence of the Lsr ABC transporter, the LsrB protein of which serves as the AI-2 receptor in many of these organisms |CITS: [18803868]| (see |FRAME: ABC-58-CPLX|).  The precursor of AI-2 is synthesized by the enzyme &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-ribosylhomocysteine lyase, which also catalyzes a step in the SAM cycle.  The enzyme converts &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-ribosyl-L-homocysteine to L-homocysteine and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione. Within the SAM cycle, the main product of the enzyme is L-homocysteine.  In AI-2 biosynthesis 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione is of major importance as it appears to be nonenzymatically converted in a series of chemical modifications to the mature autoinducer.  The exact nature of the chemical transformations depends on the species. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and most pathogenic bacteria that form AI-2 the spontaneous transformations include cyclization to (2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one and hydration to the final autoinducer (2&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran. This form of the autoinducer, which was first characterized from &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;, was shown to be different from the form that was initially described from &lt;i&gt;Vibrio harveyi&lt;/i&gt; (see below) and is recognized by the LsrB periplasmic binding protein |CITS: [15350213]|.  Members of the order Vibrionales produce a different form of the autoinducer. In those organisms, 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione appears to form a different stereoisomer, namely (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-methyl-2,4-dihydroxydihydrofuran-3-one, which hydrates to (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran and forms a complex with a borate ion to form (2&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;,4&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-2-methyl-2,3,3,4-tetrahydroxytetrahydrofuran-borate |CITS: [11823863][18803868]|,  (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-6154|).

The molecular mechanisms of energy taxis are closely related to those of chemotaxis whereby bacteria respond to specific chemical attractants and repellents in their external environment (see |FRAME: PWY0-1518 &quot;chemotactic two-component signal transduction&quot;|).

    <attribute name="description" value="A bewildering number of post-transcriptional modifications are introduced into cellular RNAs by different enzymes |CITS: [12581659]|.  The most abundant post-transcriptional nucleobase modification in cellular RNAs is the isomerization of |FRAME: URIDINE| to |FRAME: CPD-497|, which is carried out by the enzyme pseudouridine synthase in a reaction that does not require any cofactors.  In pseudouridine, uracil is bound to the ribose through C5 rather than through N1, as is the case for uridine.  The synthase severs the normal glycosidic C-N bond of uridine, flips the uracil moiety along its N3-C6 axis, and forms a glycosidic C-C bond with C5.  Pseudouridine is one of few molecules that have a glycosidic C-C bond.  Pseudouridine synthases belong to four different families, which are represented in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; by the |FRAME: EG10454|, |FRAME: EG11177|, |FRAME: EG12609| and |FRAME: EG12044| genes.  The only sequence element that is absolutely conserved among the four families of enzymes is a catalytic aspartic acid |CITS: [9425056][11720289][10428788]|.  Pseudouridylation is found in organisms from all kingdoms.  Mammalian rRNA contains about 100 pseudouridines per ribosome, and tRNAs contain an average of 3 - 4 pseudouridines.  While many eukaryotes possess the ability to degrade pseudouridine, mammals appear to have lost this ability, and pseudouridine is excreted in their urine.  Pseudouridine has been shown to serve as a source of uracil for a strain of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; that is deficient in pyrimidine synthesis |CITS: [4882030]|.  It was shown that pseudouridine was first phosphorylated by a kinase to |FRAME: PSEUDOURIDINE-5-P| |CITS: [4334133]|, followed by hydrolysis to |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and |FRAME: URACIL| |CITS: [4912525]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="Enteric bacteria must be able to survive extremely acidic conditions in order pass through the stomachs of their hosts.  &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt; contains acid resistance systems in order to maintain an internal pH of about 4.0 to 5.0 in a highly acidic environment with a pH of 2.0 to 2.5.  Acid resistance system 3 (AR3) is the arginine-dependent acid resistance system which couples the transport activity of an arginine:agmatine antiporter, AdiC, with arginine decarboxylase, AdiA.  AdiC functions by exchanging external arginine for internal agmatine.  Arginine is imported into the cell through AdiC.  Within the cell arginine is decarboxylated by AdiA to agmatine, releasing CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and replacing it with a proton.  Agmatine is then exported through AdiC.  This effectively consumes protons within the cytoplasm, raising the pH.  An additional effect of the acid resistance systems that may be more important for survival is a reversal of the membrane potential such that a build-up of positive charges within the cell due to influx of protons and increased agmatine concentrations will counteract proton influx beyond a certain limit.  ClC chloride channels provide a control mechanism to help maintain appropriate membrane potential by mediating chloride import coupled to proton export.  AR2 is more efficient than AR3 or AR4 as a mediator of acid resistance at low pH. |CITS:[15494746],[12964244]|"/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The inorganic sulfur compound |FRAME: S2O3| contains two sulfur atoms: a sulfone-sulfur (oxidation state +V), and a sulfane-sulfur (oxidation state -I).  At low pH, thiosulfate decomposes spontaneously to |FRAME: SO3| and elemental sulfur |CITS: [4552952]|.  At neutral pH, the compound is relatively stable, but several types of bacteria can catalyze its disproportionation in a process in which thiosulfate serves as both an electron donor and an electron acceptor.  Several types of enzymes have been described that are able to catalyze the disproportionation of thiosulfate.  These enzymes have been differentiated based on the nature of the electron donor: some enzymes require thiols for this purpose, others utilize organic electron donors such as pyruvate, as well as molecular hydrogen in the presence of a hydrogenase, and some enzymes have only been active &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; when coupled to cyanide.  These three classes of enzymes are described in the MetaCyc pathways |FRAME:PWY-5277|, |FRAME:PWY-5352| and this pathway, respectively.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase is more often referred to by the name rhodanese, from the German word for thiocyanate, &quot;rhodanid&quot;.  The enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable sulfur donors to nucleophilic sulfur acceptors.  The original description of rhodanese, purified from bovine mitochondria, used thiosulfate and cyanide for this purpose.  Rhodanese is a widespread enzyme, and has been detected in many major phyla, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic |CITS: [6357923]|.  Despite its ubiquity, the physiological role of rhodanese has not yet been established unambiguously.  It has been suggested that rhodanese is involved in detoxification of cyanide in both mammals |CITS: [3073057][10762072]| and bacteria |CITS: [18685272]|.  It has also been proposed that rhodanese, using the dithiol |FRAME: CPD-296| as the sulfur acceptor, may act as a sulfur insertase involved in the formation of prosthetic groups in iron-sulfur proteins, such as ferredoxin |CITS: [6430704][2983992]|.  Rhodanese performs the reaction by a double displacement formal mechanism.  The crystal structure of rhodanese from |FRAME: TAX-354| has been determined at 1.8 &amp;Aring;, and the study revealed that the active form of the enzyme is a persulfide, where a sulfur is attached to the active cysteine residue |CITS: [10788330]|.  Unlike the enzyme |FRAME: MONOMER-12520|, which catalyzes a similar reaction in which thiosulfate is disproportionated into |FRAME: SO3| and |FRAME: HS|, monothiols such as glutathione are poor substrates for rhodanese |CITS: [14086740][5333153][10735872]|.  The distinction between thiosulfate reductase and rhodanese is not always straightforward.  For example, Aird et al purified an enzyme from |FRAME: TAX-471| that could catalyze either reaction under different conditions |CITS: [3480285]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="The pathways of biosynthesis of phenylalanine and tyrosine are intimately connected. The first step of both pathways is the conversion of chorismate to prephenate; the third step of both is the conversion of a ketoacid to the aminoacid through transamination.  The two pathways differ only in the second step of their three-step reaction sequences:  In the case of phenylalanine biosynthesis a dehydratase converts prephenate to phenylpyruvate (a reaction that occurs slowly in the absence of enzymic acitivity); in the case of tyrosine biosynthesis, a dehydrogenase converts prephenate to p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate.  Also in both pathways the first two steps are catalyzed by two distinct active sites on a single protein.  Thus the first step of each pathway can be catalyzed by two enzymes: those associated with both the phenylalanine-specific dehydratase and the tyrosine-specific dehydrogenase.  Three enzymes, those encoded by &lt;i&gt;tyrB, aspC&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt;, are involved in catalyzing the third step of these pathways: all three can contribute to the synthesis of phenylalanine; only TyrB and AspC contribute to the biosynthesis of tyrosine.  Under normal physiological conditions, TyrB is the primary enzyme contributing to the synthesis of tyrosine and phenylalanine.  AspC contributes to their synthesis when substrate pools are large.  The contribution of the &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt;-encoded enzyme to phenylalanine biosynthesis was demonstrated in triple mutants of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 that lacked all three aminotransferases and required both phenylalanine and tyrosine for growth.

    <attribute name="description" value="Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a major outer membrane component, is composed of three domains: Lipid A; the core, which is an oligosaccharide consisting of an inner and outer region; and a distal repeating unit known as O-antigen.   &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K12 is capable of producing an O-antigen when all the &lt;i&gt;rfb&lt;/i&gt; genes are intact. The O-antigen is part of the lipopolysaccharide and is attached to the lipid A-core component, which is separately synthesized. The O-antigen is a repeat unit composed of four sugars: glucose, N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and rhamnose.    This pathway depicts the synthesis of three of these sugars. UDP-galactose is transformed from its pyranose form to its furanose form. dTTP glucose-1-phosphate is derivatized to dTDP-rhamnose. Fructose-6-phosphate gains an amino group, incorporates an acetate moiety and then acquires a nucleoside diphosphate resulting in UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine.  During formation of the repeat unit, the nucleoside diphosphates are removed. The repeat unit is polymerized and attached to the outer core.  Formation and polymerization of the O-antigen repeat unit is not shown here as it is a complex macromolecular transformation which presently lies outside the scope of EcoCyc. |CITS: [7517391] [7512872] [ColiSalII]|  "/>

The first four steps are catalyzed by |FRAME: PURK-CPLX| (PurK), |FRAME: PURE-CPLX| (PurE), |FRAME: SAICARSYN-CPLX| (PurC), and |FRAME: ASL-MONOMER| (PurB), respectively.  The last two steps are catalyzed by a single, bifunctional, folate-dependent enzyme, |FRAME: AICARTRANSIMPCYCLO-CPLX| (PurH).   In contrast to higher eukaryotes in which 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole (AIR) is directly carboxylated to 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate (CAIR) by a single enzyme, in bacteria and yeast AIR is converted to CAIR in two steps.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; of AIR is carboxylated to form the unstable intermediate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-CAIR) by PurK and then &lt;i&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-CAIR is converted to CAIR by PurE |CITS: [8117684 ][19053251]|.  In the next reaction PurC catalyzes the ligation of the carboxylate group of CAIR to the amino group of aspartate to form 5'-phosphoribosyl-4-(N-succinocarboxamide)-5-aminoimidazole (SAICAR).  This amino group becomes the N(1) nitrogen atom of the final purine base.  The remaining portion of the aspartate molecule is eliminated in the next reaction as fumarate, with the formation of aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) catalyzed by PurB.  PurB is an enzyme with dual substrate specificity which also catalyzes an analogous reaction in pathway |FRAME: PWY-6126|.  In the penultimate reaction a formyl group is transferred to AICAR to form phosphoribosyl-formamido-carboxamide (FAICAR), catalyzed by the bifunctional PurH which also catalyzes cyclization of FAICAR to IMP with elimination of water |CITS: [18712276]|.

The former enzyme is the first committed step in GMP synthesis.  The latter enzyme catalyzes the replacement of an oxygen atom at the 2-position of XMP with an amino group, utilizing either L-glutamine or ammonia.  The specific kinase product of gene &lt;i&gt;gmk&lt;/i&gt; converts GMP to GDP.  GMP can also be supplied by a salvage pathway as indicated by the pathway link.  However, rapidly growing cells may require more GMP than can be supplied by the salvage pathway (reviewed in |CITS: [19480389]|).  Both GDP and GTP can be converted to the deoxy forms of the nucleotide. GTP is converted to dGTP by |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-TRIP-REDUCT-CPLX|, while GDP can be converted to dGDP by either |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX| or |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTII-CPLX|.

In addition, the enzymatic activity of ThrA is inhibited by threonine, regulating flux through the second and fourth steps in the pathway.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Methylglyoxal is produced in small amounts during glycolysis (via dihydroxyacetone phosphate), fatty acid metabolism (via acetone) and protein metabolism (via aminoacetone).  Methylglyoxal is highly toxic, most likely as a result of its interaction with protein side chains (see |CITS: [10597025]| for a review).  There are several pathways for the detoxification of methylglyoxal, based on different enzymes that are able to convert methylglyoxal to less toxic compounds.  These enzymes include glyoxalase enzymes, methylglyoxal reductases, aldose reductases, aldehyde reductases and methylglyoxal dehydrogenases.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; there are several pathways for the removal of methylglyoxal. In this pathway, methylglyoxal is reduced to acetol by the action of various enzymes possessing methylglyoxal reductase activity. Most of the enzymes that have been characterized with this activity belong to the NADPH-dependent aldo-keto reductase subfamily of the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily. AKRs are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and catalyze the reduction of carbonyl-containing aldehyde and/or ketone containing compounds to their corresponding alcohols. A few dual-specificity AKRs are also able to utilize NADH. An AKR from &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has been identified that is NADH-specific (AKR11B2, the product of gene &lt;i&gt;ydjG&lt;/i&gt;). AKRs have been of considerable interest in metabolic engineering studies |CITS: [16813561]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 enzymes homologous to mammalian AKRs have been shown to catalyze the methylglyoxal reductase reaction |CITS: [16077126]|. Overexpression of the aldo-keto reductase AKR14A1, encoded by the |FRAME:G7558| gene, leads to increased resistance to methylglyoxal |CITS: [12583903]|. In addition, three other genes |FRAME:G6967| (&lt;i&gt;yeaE&lt;/i&gt;), |FRAME:G7565| (&lt;i&gt;yqhE&lt;/i&gt;), and |FRAME:EG11648| (&lt;i&gt;yafB&lt;/i&gt;) were shown to encode proteins with similar activities.

Before the sulfur can be assimilated into biosynthetic pathways it needs to be reduced to |FRAME: HS|.  Pathways catalyzing the reduction of sulfate to sulfide for the purpose of incorporation into newly synthesized molecules are called pathways of &lt;b&gt;assimilatory sulfate reduction&lt;/b&gt;.  In addition, certain organisms can use sulfate as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence of oxygen.  Pathways of sulfate reduction for the purpose of energy production are called pathways of &lt;b&gt;dissimilatory sulfate reduction&lt;/b&gt;.  The reduction of sulfate to sulfite requires two electrons at a standard redox potential (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'&lt;/i&gt;) of -516 mV, which is too high for physiological electron carriers |CITS: [860983]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General background&lt;/b&gt;  The amino acid glutamine is a constituent of proteins and a nitrogen donor for many biosynthetic reactions,  including the biosynthesis of amino acids, purines, pyrimidines, glucosamime and carbamoyl phosphate.  The  biosynthesis of glutamine is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase, a key enzyme of nitrogen metabolism found in  all domains of life.  Phylogenetic analysis of glutamine synthetase genes has suggested that they are among the  oldest functioning genes in the history of evolution |CITS: [8096645]|.  In microorganisms and plants, glutamine  synthetase (also known as GS) has a role in ammonia assimilation in combination with glutamate synthase  (glutamine: &amp;alpha;-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, or GOGAT) as indicated by the pathway links and pathways  |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-3282|).  This is known as the GS/GOGAT pathway  |CITS: [GOTTSCHALK1986]|.  &lt;b&gt;About this pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway serves as a major mechanism of ammonia assimilation during nitrogen limitation. It has only one reaction, which is catalyzed by glutamine synthetase. There are three types of glutamine synthetase, differing in number of subunits. Glutamine synthetase type I is found mostly in bacteria and archaea, including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; (reviewed in |CITS: [11585846]|). It is a well-studied homododecamer built from two back-to-back hexameric rings |CITS: [5336023][242004][241853][3654][28418]|. The enzyme contains two metal-binding sites (n1 and n2) to which Mg2+ or Mn2+ can bind. Binding at the n1 site leads to stabilization of the protein and facilitates the binding of glutamate to the catalytic site, whereas metal binding to the n2 site is implicated in phosphoryl transfer (reviewed in: Stadtman E. R (2004) &quot;Regulation of Glutamine Synthetase Activity.&quot; EcoSal 3.6.1.6 |CITS: [ecosal]|. "/>

It is biosynthesized in a highly regulated manner when carbon is plentiful, but other nutrients are limiting (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|). Glycogen is utilized when carbon sources become limiting. The regulation of endogenous glycogen metabolism in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; remains incompletely understood |CITS: [17543954][19702577][20118147][21029047]| and has been the subject of metabolic modeling studies |CITS: [21421758][22750467]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; genes &lt;i&gt;glgP&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glgX&lt;/i&gt; are involved in glycogen degradation, whereas &lt;i&gt;glgA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;glgB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glgC&lt;/i&gt; are involved in glycogen biosynthesis. Earlier studies suggested that the &lt;i&gt;glg&lt;/i&gt; genes for glycogen metabolism are clustered into two tandemly arranged operons, &lt;i&gt;glgBX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glgCAP&lt;/i&gt;. However, more recent transcription studies in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 demonstrated that genes &lt;i&gt;glgBXCAP&lt;/i&gt; are transcribed in a single transcriptional unit under the control of promoter sequences upstream of &lt;i&gt;glgB&lt;/i&gt;. In addition, a promoter within &lt;i&gt;glgC&lt;/i&gt; controls the expression of &lt;i&gt;glgA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glgP&lt;/i&gt;. These transcription units are part of both the RelA and PhoP-PhoQ regulons |CITS: [21029047]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; cannot grow on exogenous |FRAME: Glycogens &quot;glycogen&quot;|, |FRAME: Starch|, or |FRAME: Pullulans|), although they are able to grow on linear &amp;alpha;-1,4-linked |FRAME: Maltodextrins &quot;maltodextrins&quot;| ranging in size from maltose to maltodextrins of up to about 20 glucose units in length (in Mayer and Boos |CITS: [ecosal]|, see below).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The &lt;i&gt;glgP&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;glgX&lt;/i&gt; genes are involved in the initial breakdown of glycogen. During endogenous glycogen degradation, the glycogen phosphorylase product of gene &lt;i&gt;glgP&lt;/i&gt; shortens the glycogen chains sequentially from their nonreducing end to produce a limit dextrin (also called a glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin). Overexpression of &lt;i&gt;glgP&lt;/i&gt; can decrease glycogen to undetectable levels, and the lowering of glycogen levels directly correlates with increases in the expression of glycogen phosphorylase activity. The debranching enzyme product of &lt;i&gt;glgX&lt;/i&gt; removes &amp;alpha;-1,6-linked branches that are a maximum of four glucosyl residues in length to produce a debranched limit dextrin (also called a debranched glycogen phosphorylase limit dextrin). It is therefore likely that GlgX releases maltotetraose from glycogen and also plays an important role in the production of maltotriose, an endogenous inducer of the maltose system (see below) |CITS: [16816199][15687211]|.   Further breakdown of the maltodextrin intermediates, maltotetraose, maltotriose and maltose involves the products of the maltose utilization genes &lt;i&gt;malP, malZ and malQ&lt;/i&gt;. These genes are part of the maltose/maltodextrin regulon controlled by MalT, a transcriptional activator that is activated by maltotriose |CITS: [16321936][16816199][19028900]|.   Maltodextrin phosphorylase encoded by &lt;i&gt;malP&lt;/i&gt; phosphorylytically cleaves glucosyl residues from the nonreducing end of maltodextrins producing &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate and a shortened maltodextrin. Maltotetraose is the smallest substrate, therefore the ultimate product of MalP action on a maltodextrin is the inducer maltotriose |CITS: [16816199][16321936]|. &amp;alpha;-D-glucose 1-phosphate is converted to &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;pgm&lt;/i&gt;. &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate can spontaneously convert to its &amp;beta; epimer and enter central metabolism as shown in the pathway link.   Maltodextrin glucosidase encoded by &lt;i&gt;malZ&lt;/i&gt; can cleave &amp;alpha;-D-glucose residues sequentially from the reducing end of maltodextrins, with the smallest substrate being maltotriose. In the case of maltotriose, the reaction products are &amp;alpha;-D-glucose and maltose. The former compound is a source of glucose for the cell and can spontaneously epimerize to &amp;beta;-D-glucose (|FRAME: ALDOSE-1-EPIMERASE-RXN|) and enter central metabolism as shown in the pathway link. Although MalZ is a maltodextrin-specific enzyme, its exact role is unclear and it is not essential for maltose or maltodextrin utilization |CITS: [16816199][19028900]|.  Amylomaltase encoded by &lt;i&gt;malQ&lt;/i&gt; is a 4-&amp;alpha;-glucanotransferase that is essential for maltose degradation. MalQ mutants are unable to grow on maltose. Amylomaltase preferentially removes glucose from the reducing ends of maltose and small maltodextrins, transferring the enzyme-bound dextrinyl residue to the nonreducing ends of other maltodextrins, thereby forming longer maltodextrins (in |CITS: [21421758]|). In this process the number of glucosidic linkages remains constant. Therefore MalQ can both degrade and synthesize the inducer maltotriose, allowing induction when the bacteria are grown on maltodextrins |CITS: [16816199]|. The &amp;beta;-D-glucose formed is phosphorylated by glucokinase and the resulting &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate enters glycolysis.  Reviews:  Mayer, C. and W.

KdpD is a membrane-bound sensor kinase which, upon activation, autophosphorylates and transfers a phosphoryl group to the cytoplasmic response regulator KdpE |CITS: [8223625], [8798785], [9099740], [11016946]|.

The primary stimulus perceived by the KpdDE TCS is uncertain. Early work (|CITS: [6787588], [9748442]| and reviewed in |CITS: [1449064]|) suggested that the Kdp system was controlled by turgor pressure (the difference in osmotic pressure across the inner membrane) although this has been disputed |CITS: [8331081], [18245296]|.

Analysis and modeling of the Kdp system under conditions of limiting potassium suggests an inverse correlation between KdpDE phosphorylation and the intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. Under this model low intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; levels result in inhibition of the phosphatase activity of KdpD and increased expression of &lt;i&gt;kdpFABC&lt;/i&gt; whereas an increase in free intracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; enhances KpdD phosphatase activity, leading to a decrease in phospho-KdpE and decreased expression of the high affinity K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transporter |CITS: [24657232]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  In prokaryotes and eukaryotes heme (protoheme IX, protoheme, heme &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;) is an iron-containing prosthetic group found in many essential proteins including cytochromes and heme-containing globins. In addition to its role in oxidative metabolism, heme also functions as a regulatory molecule in transcription, translation, protein targeting, protein stability, and cellular differentiation.  Heme is a porphyrin member of the cyclic tetrapyrroles. Even though it is biosynthesized as protoheme IX, different derivatives of protoheme IX can be formed that differ in modifications to the porphyrin ring, including the way it is bound to the protein, such as heme &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;, heme &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;, heme &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, and heme &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.  In various organisms important branch points within the heme biosynthetic pathway lead to the biosynthesis of other important compounds such as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin) (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: P381-PWY|), coenzyme F430 (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5196|), siroheme (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5194|), heme D (see EcoCyc reaction |FRAME: RXN-8073|), and bacteriochlorophyll (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: CHLOROPHYLL-SYN|).  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; heme biosynthesis begins with L-glutamate and proceeds through 5-amino-levulinate (the universal tetrapyrrole precursor) to uroporphyrinogen III as shown in the |FRAME: PWY-5188| pathway link.  Uroporphyrinogen III is converted to protoheme IX in the pathway shown here.  Subsequent reactions that produce heme &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; and heme &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; are shown in the reaction links. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; hemes &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt; function as the prosthetic groups for &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-type cytochromes, cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bd&lt;/i&gt;, and cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bo&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.  The &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-type cytochromes are synthesized only anaerobically in the presence of nitrogenous electron acceptors.  Cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bd&lt;/i&gt;, and cytochrome &lt;i&gt;bo&lt;/i&gt; are O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-reducing terminal oxidase complexes.    Although regulation of heme biosynthesis is not well studied in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, evidence suggests that the cellular level of free protoheme IX controls the rate of heme synthesis at the level of formation of glutamate-1-semialdehyde by glutamyl-tRNA reductase encoded by &lt;i&gt;hemA&lt;/i&gt; (see EcoCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5188|).

The pathway links at the beginning and end of this pathway show the preceding and succeeding steps.  This pathway describes the aerobic route for protoheme IX biosynthesis. It involves the enzyme coproporphyrinogen III oxidase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;hemF&lt;/i&gt;, which requires molecular oxygen for the conversion of coproporphyrinogen III to protoporphyrinogen IX.  In this pathway the four acetate groups of uroporphyrinogen III are sequentially decarboxylated and the methyl groups from these four acetates remain in coproporphyrinogen III.  Two propionate groups at positions 3 and 8 of coproporphyrinogen III are oxidatively decarboxylated to vinyl groups by the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-requiring product of gene &lt;i&gt;hemF&lt;/i&gt;, producing protoporphyrinogen IX |CITS: [12975365]|.  In  the facultatively aerobic &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium, an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-independent enzyme, coproporphyrinogen dehydrogenase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;hemN&lt;/i&gt; can function under anaerobic conditions.  HemN contains an O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster |CITS: [14633981]| (see pathway |FRAME: HEMESYN2-PWY|).  In the next step six electrons are removed from protoporphyrinogen IX by a membrane-associated oxidase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;hemG&lt;/i&gt; forming protoporphyrin IX. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; under aerobic conditions this enzyme uses O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as electron acceptor, while under anaerobic conditions oxidation is coupled to the reduction of nitrate or fumarate |CITS: [20484676][365243]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Microorganisms and mammals share two of the major, initial routes for threonine degradation.  In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate.  A biosynthetic version of this enzyme also occurs (see |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA.  The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be spontaneously converted to aminoacetone, which may be further metabolized to methylglyoxal (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi.  This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:LTAA-CPLX| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into glycine and acetaldehyde.  &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; has been shown to assimilate nitrogen from some (but not all) amino acids, as well as agmatine, &amp;gamma;-aminobutyrate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine.  These nitrogen sources are used to generate glutamate and glutamine, the major intracellular nitrogen donors.  Some nitrogen sources, such as aspartate, can generate glutamate by transamination (see |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|).  Others, such as proline and arginine, produce glutamate as end products (glutamate generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| and |FRAME: AST-PWY|).  Other nitrogen sources, such as serine, require ammonia production for glutamate synthesis (ammonia generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Ammonia generation is required for glutamine synthesis (see |FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|).  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; a low intracellular level of ammonia results in low intracellular glutamine and induction of the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response that involves response regulators |FRAME: GLNG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLNL-CPLX|.  The Ntr response functions in ammonia assimilation, nitrogen scavenging and metabolic coordination.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has three systems that can transport threonine:  |FRAME: YGJU-MONOMER| |CITS: [12097162]|, |FRAME: ABC-15-CPLX| |CITS: [4583203]|, and |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| |CITS: [2115866]|.  Although &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can use threonine, glycine, or serine as a nitrogen source, efficient serine or threonine utilization requires amino acid supplementation.  Leucine supplementation is required for the use of threonine as a nitrogen source in pathways utilizing |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) which is induced by leucine |CITS: [334738]| (see |FRAME: THREONINE-DEG2-PWY| and |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  TDH is is a major route for threonine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  A minor pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5436| and an anaerobic pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5437|.  Reviews: Reitzer, L. (2005) &quot;Catabolism of Amino Acids and Related Compounds&quot; EcoSal 3.4.7 |CITS: [ecosal]| and |CITS: [12730324]|  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) catalyzes the NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent oxidation of threonine to 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate which is typically converted by |FRAME:AKBLIG-CPLX| into glycine and acetyl-CoA (see |FRAME:THREONINE-DEG2-PWY|).  However, it has been shown that 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be non-enzymatically decarboxylated to aminoacetone.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, a mutant that overproduced TDH utilized threonine as the sole carbon source and excreted glycine and aminoacetone into the medium.  Crude extracts of this mutant catalyzed a quantitative conversion of threonine to glycine and aminoacetone |CITS: [6413491]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the subsequent metabolism of aminoacetone remains unclear.  In eukaryotic cells aminoacetone is oxidized to toxic methylglyoxal by semicarbazide-sensitive, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent amine oxidases in a reaction yielding methylglyoxal, hydrogen peroxide and ammonia |CITS: [6833209][8920635][11559049]|.  However, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; contains a periplasmic |FRAME: AMINEOXID-CPLX| encoded by &lt;i&gt;tynA&lt;/i&gt; that could hypothetically convert aminoacetone to methylglyoxal as predicted in this pathway.  Another possible route for aminoacetone metabolism was suggested by |CITS: [3920199]| who characterized an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme that stereospecifically and reversibly catalyzed the reduction of aminoacetone to D-1-amino-2-propanol (see |FRAME: GLYCDEH-CPLX|).  Methylglyoxal is toxic to &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [15489434]|, although it can be degraded as shown in the pathway link.  Older literature reporting on the metabolism of aminoacetone in other microorganisms may also be relevant to &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Aminoacetone was first isolated and identified in the supernatant from washed cell suspensions of &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; incubated with threonine |CITS: [13820014]|.  Subsequent reports were summarized by |CITS: [4292865]| who concluded that a number of microorganisms can metabolize aminoacetone via methylglyoxal.  In a species of &lt;i&gt;Arthrobacter&lt;/i&gt;, aminoacetone in the growth medium was shown to be oxidatively deaminated to methylglyoxal by a putative amine oxidase |CITS: [5721463]|.  The conversion of aminoacetone to methylglyoxal has also been suggested to occur in &lt;i&gt;Serratia marcescens&lt;/i&gt; although it was not experimentally demonstrated |CITS: [355220]|.   In cell-free extracts of a strain of &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; grown on nutrient broth, aminoacetone was formed from threonine and was alternatively transaminated to methylglyoxal or reduced to 1-aminopropan-2-ol |CITS: [4986871]|.  In threonine-grown &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, data suggested that aminoacetone was reduced to 1-aminopropan-2-ol by a distinct aminoacetone NADH reductase |CITS: [4292837][4334917]|.  A &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas&lt;/i&gt; species utilized aminoacetone in a pathway involving its metabolism to L-1-aminopropan-2-ol by L-1-aminopropan-2-ol-NAD(P) oxidoreductase, with subsequent reactions converting the latter compound to propionate |CITS: [4362743]|."/>

Any of these four compounds can serve as a total source of pyrimidine for both ribonucleoside triphosphates and subsequently for both deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates as well (see |FRAME: PWY0-166|).  Exogenously supplied cytosine is rapidly converted to uracil and subsequently converted to UMP which flows through a portion of the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway to UTP and CTP.   Although enzymes are present in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; that are capable of converting cytidine directly to CTP, in fact exogenously supplied cytidine does not flow through this pathway.  Instead, a very active cytidine deaminase converts it rapidly to uridine, which then flows to UTP and then to CTP.  The existence of the direct pathway from cytidine to CTP is an accident of the lack of specificity of uridine kinase.  Exogenously supplied cytidine will flow directly to CTP if cytidine deaminase is blocked by mutation.  A CMP-specific kinase is present in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Its purpose is not to utilize externally supplied cytosine.  Instead, it is to recover CMP generated intracellularly by the hydrolytic turnover of RNA.        "/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Pyrimidine and purine nucleoside triphosphates are the activated precursors of DNA and RNA.  Their diphosphates form activated derivatives of other molecules, such as |FRAME: UDP-GLUCOSE|, for use in biosynthesis.  The pathway for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides is derived from the pathway for |FRAME: PWY0-162| as shown above in the pathway links.  In addition to &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis, salvage pathways re-utilize exogenous free bases and nucleosides and some of the resulting pyrimidine nucleotides can enter the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis pathways (see |FRAME: PWY0-181| and |FRAME: PWY0-163|).  These essential, evolutionarily conserved biosynthetic and salvage pathways are found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.  The pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate products of these pathways are incorporated into DNA (|FRAME: DCTP| and |FRAME: TTP|) and RNA (|FRAME: CTP| and |FRAME: UTP|).  The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthetic pathways are necessary in order to supply the cell with nucleoside triphosphates for stable RNA and DNA synthesis when precursors are limiting.  These biosynthetic pathways consume relatively large amounts of high energy phosphate and reducing power.  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; they are regulated both by allosteric enzymes and at the gene expression level in order to conserve resources under different growth conditions.  The pyrimidine nucleotide &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthetic pathways derive in part from the central metabolic precursors |FRAME: OXALACETIC_ACID| and |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P|.  Oxaloacetate from the |FRAME: TCA| gives rise to the aspartate family of amino acids and |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| is a precursor of both pyrimidine ribonucleotides and nicotinamide coenzymes (see |FRAME: ASPARTATESYN-PWY|).  The overall pathway begins with the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P| from bicarbonate, phosphate from ATP and nitrogen from glutamine.  This compound then condenses with |FRAME: L-ASPARTATE| to form |FRAME: CARBAMYUL-L-ASPARTATE| as shown in pathways |FRAME: PWY0-162| and |FRAME: PWY-5686|.  The overall pathway branches at |FRAME: CARBAMOYL-P|, which is an intermediate in |FRAME: ARG| biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ARGSYN-PWY|).  The activated intermediate |FRAME: PRPP| is derived from |FRAME: RIBOSE-5P| and is a precursor in the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; and salvage pathways for pyrimidine and purine nucleotides, as well as in biosynthetic pathways for nucleotide coenzymes, |FRAME: HIS| and |FRAME: TRP| (see |FRAME: PRPP-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY0-662| and |FRAME: PWY0-661|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The pathway shown here illustrates the point at which the pyrimidine ribonucleotides |FRAME: CDP|, |FRAME: CTP|, |FRAME: UDP| and |FRAME: UTP| are converted to their corresponding deoxyribonucleotides and the DNA-specific thymine deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate |FRAME: TTP| is formed.  Deoxyribonucleotides are synthesized by reduction of ribonucleotides, which is regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme ribonucleotide reductase that carries out reduction at the C2' position.  This enzyme has a central role in DNA replication and repair.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; this ribo- to deoxyribo- conversion is catalyzed by aerobic ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase, or anaerobic ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase.  Electrons for these reductions are derived from |FRAME: NADPH| and are transferred via |FRAME: Red-Thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|, or |FRAME: Reduced-flavodoxins|.  The ribonucleotide reductase product of genes |FRAME: EG10660| and |FRAME: EG10661| functions aerobically and under microaerophilic conditions.  A normally cryptic enzyme encoded by genes |FRAME: EG20257| and |FRAME: EG12381| cannot support aerobic, or microaerophilic growth in a &lt;i&gt;nrdAB&lt;/i&gt; deletion mutant.  However, it supports aerobic growth in such a mutant when genes &lt;i&gt;nrdHIEF&lt;/i&gt; are overexpressed on a plasmid |CITS: [16771665]|.  It has been speculated that this additional aerobic enzyme may enhance ribonucleotide reductase activity under conditions of oxidative stress.  The anaerobic enzyme is encoded by gene |FRAME: EG11417| which functions in a multienzyme complex with the products of genes |FRAME: G812| and |FRAME: EG10628|.  Pathways for the reduction of these reductase enzymes have also been studied |CITS: [16771665]|.  The major pathway for the aerobic, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of the intermediate |FRAME: DUMP|, the immediate precursor of thymine-containing nucleotides, is via phosphorylation of |FRAME: DCDP| to |FRAME: DCTP| and deamination of |FRAME: DCTP| to |FRAME: DUTP| which is hydrolyzed to |FRAME: DUMP|.  This pathway supplies 70-80% of total |FRAME: DUMP| |CITS: [17651436]|.  Most of the remainder is presumed to be formed from |FRAME: DUDP|, as shown.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |FRAME: EG11418|, |FRAME: EG10219| mutants, an alternate &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; deoxycytidine pathway to |FRAME: DUMP| is used that relies on salvage enzymes |CITS: [17827303]|.  Formation of the DNA-specific end product |FRAME: TTP| requires reductive methylation of |FRAME: DUMP| to |FRAME: TMP| by |FRAME: METHYLENE-THF| catalyzed by |FRAME: THYMIDYLATESYN-CPLX|.  Two phosphorylations follow to form |FRAME: TTP|.  The first step is catalyzed by the highly specific |FRAME: DTMPKI-MONOMER|, while the second step is catalyzed by the product of gene |FRAME: EG10650| which also catalyzes two preceding reactions.

Flavin cofactors are usually bound to proteins through strong covalent or non-covalent interactions; in this system, however, the flavin serves as a substrate for both enzymes and is not bound as a prosthetic group.

    <attribute name="description" value="Leucine biosynthesis involves a five-step conversion process starting with the valine precursor 2-keto-isovalerate. The final step in this pathway is catalyzed by two transaminases of broad specificity, IlvE and TyrB.  Both the first enzyme in the pathway, 2-isopropylmalate synthase, and the terminal transaminase TyrB are suppressed by leucine. TyrB is subject to inhibition by the pathway's starting compound, 2-keto-isovalerate, and by one of its off-pathway products, tyrosine. One consequence of this inhibition by 2-keto-isovalerate is that in the absence of IlvE activity, mutations in earlier steps in the pathway cannot be compensated for by any alternate method of introducing 2-ketoisocaproate for conversion to leucine.  Almost all of the genes coding for enzymes in this pathway are controlled by attenuation. Attenuation in operon |FRAME: TU00179| is effected by a leader region containing four leucines and a transcriptional terminator |CITS: [6171647][6195343]|. &lt;i&gt;ilvE&lt;/i&gt; is a component of operon |FRAME: TU524|, that has an attenuation region containing codons for isoleucine, leucine, and valine, as well as a termination site |CITS: [6154938][2007556]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; tryptophan is biosynthesized from chorismate, the principal common precursor of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine, as well as the essential compounds tetrahydrofolate, ubiquinone-8, menaquinone-8 and enterobactin (enterochelin), as shown in the |FRAME: ALL-CHORISMATE-PWY|.  Five genes encode five enzymes that catalyze tryptophan biosynthesis from chorismate.  The five genes &lt;i&gt;trpE trpD trpC trpB trpA&lt;/i&gt; form a single transcription unit, the &lt;i&gt;trp&lt;/i&gt; operon.  A weak internal promoter also exists within the &lt;i&gt;trpD&lt;/i&gt; structural gene that provides low, constitutive levels of mRNA, although its exact physiological function is unclear |CITS: [6305961]|.  Two of the genes in the &lt;i&gt;trp&lt;/i&gt; operon encode bifunctional enzymes, each containing two independent catalytic domains.  Thus, a total of seven catalytic domains are involved in tryptophan biosynthesis.  The two bifunctional enzymes encoded by &lt;i&gt;trp D&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trpC&lt;/i&gt; appear to have arisen from ancestral gene fusion events with &lt;i&gt;trpG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trpF&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.  Gene &lt;i&gt;trpG&lt;/i&gt; which encodes a glutamine amidotransferase subunit of anthranilate synthase and gene &lt;i&gt;trpF&lt;/i&gt; which encodes a phosphoribosyl-anthranilate isomerase exist separately in some organisms.  Two hetromultimeric, &amp;alpha;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;beta;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; protein complexes participate in the pathway, anthranilate synthase formed from the products of genes &lt;i&gt;trpD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trpE&lt;/i&gt; and tryptophan synthase formed from the products of genes &lt;i&gt;trpA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;trpB&lt;/i&gt;.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The two last steps in this pathway are catalyzed by a single enzyme, tryptophan synthase, which is composed of two &amp;alpha; and two &amp;beta; subunits (E.C. reaction 4.2.1.20).  However, it has been shown that each of the subunits is responsible for catalyzing an individual step, and is able to catalyze that step on its own.  Thus, the activity of tryptophan synthase was divided into two individual steps in the pathway, each catalyzed by the corresponding subunit.  Indole is not a free intermediate, it is transferred between subunits within the enzyme complex |CITS: [1899028]|.  As shown in the transport links in this pathway, evidence suggests that exogenous serine |CITS: [9852024]| and indole |CITS: [1917834]| may also contribute to tryptophan biosynthesis.  The rate-limiting step in this pathway has not been fully defined.  A spontaneous enol/keto tautomerization of 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino-1'-deoxyribulose-5'-phosphate has been postulated as rate-limiting in the pathway, but it remains to be proven |CITS: [7727401]|.  In addition, chorismate synthase (see |FRAME: ARO-PWY|) has been proposed as a rate limiting enzyme in the common aromatic pathway (see the superpathway links below) based upon its apparently constitutive synthesis and its relatively low specific activity in cell extracts (see EcoSal reference below).  The biosynthesis of tryptophan is an energetically costly process due to its requirement for D-erythrose-4-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate and ATP for chorismate biosynthesis, as well as glutamine, phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate and serine for the conversion of chorismate to tryptophan.  The pathway is therefore highly regulated at multiple levels and its regulation has been studied in great detail.  Transcriptional regulation by repression is mediated by tryptophan binding to the &lt;i&gt;trp&lt;/i&gt; repressor, a product of the unlinked &lt;i&gt;trpR&lt;/i&gt; gene.  Regulation also occurs by a complex transcriptional attenuation mechanism involving synthesis of the tryptophan-containing leader peptide encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;trpL&lt;/i&gt;, mediated by the availability of tryptophan-charged tRNA&lt;sup&gt;trp&lt;/sup&gt; (see EcoCyc transcription unit page |FRAME: TU00067| for a detailed summary of &lt;i&gt;trp&lt;/i&gt; operon transcriptional regulation mechanisms).  Post-translational regulation occurs by allosteric feedback inhibiton of anthranilate synthase by tryptophan.  Reviewed in |CITS: [15262409] [12966138] [17601995]|.  The homologous tryptophan operon of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;) has also been well studied and the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway shown here also applies to this organism.

This novel pathway for pyrimidine degradation was discovered by a combination of functional and comparative genomics techniques including high-throughput microarray and phenotype analysis |CITS: [16540542]|.  The pathway depicted here represents a combination of experimental work and functional predictions based on the available evidence |CITS: [20400551]|.

The initial product of the reaction appears to be |FRAME: CPD0-2338|, which is unstable and can be slowly reduced to ureidoacrylate |CITS: [20369853][20400551]|.  While the |FRAME: G6522-MONOMER &quot;RutB&quot;| enzyme is able to hydrolyze ureidoacrylate, it is thought to hydrolyze peroxyureidoacrylate &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, yielding carbamate and |FRAME: CPD0-2340|.  In a spontaneous reaction, carbamate decomposes into one molecule each of |FRAME: AMMONIA| and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Aminoacrylate can then hydrolyze either spontaneously or enzymatically to  |FRAME: MALONATE-S-ALD| and a second molecule of ammonia.  Malonate semialdehyde appears to be toxic and can not be utilized further.  The compound may be detoxified by one of two malonic semialdehyde reductases to |FRAME: 3-HYDROXY-PROPIONATE|, which is then excreted into the medium.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The biosynthesis of L-arginine in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes is notable for its complexity and variability at the genetic level, and by its connection with several other pathways, such as pyrimidine and polyamine biosynthesis and certain degradative pathways.  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; the L-arginine biosynthetic genes are scattered in several units of expression on the chromosome and are not strictly coordinated.  Synthesis of the L-arginine biosynthetic enzymes is repressed by L-arginine under control of the arginine repressor encoded by the &lt;i&gt;argR&lt;/i&gt; gene, forming the arginine regulon |CITS: [17074904][14168690]|.  In stationary phase cultures, positive control by RpoS is also required for full control of arginine biosynthesis |CITS: [16504055]|.  The initial steps in the L-arginine biosynthesis pathway proceed via &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylated intermediates to L-ornithine, as shown here and in pathway |FRAME: GLUTORN-PWY|.  The presumed reason for the acetylation is that it prevents the spontaneous cyclization of L-glutamate derivatives, which leads to L-proline biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PROSYN-PWY|) thus keeping the pathways leading to L-arginine and L-proline separate (|CITS: [12633501]| and references therein).  In microorganisms two alternative pathways have evolved that differ in the way the key intermediate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed and in the way the acetyl group is removed from another key intermediate, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In this pathway, which is less common but found in the &lt;i&gt;Enterobacteriaceae&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate is formed by &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate synthase and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine is hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase, forming L-ornithine and acetate.  In the other pathway which is found in most prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms, the two reactions are linked: the acetyl group which is removed from &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine is recycled onto L-glutamate, regenerating &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-glutamate (see |FRAME: ARGSYNBSUB-PWY|).  In a third pathway found in several eubacteria &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine is transcarbamylated directly to &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-citrulline, followed by deacetylation to L-citrulline (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5154|) (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In this pathway L-glutamate is acetylated to the key intermediate &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-glutamate by the enzyme &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-glutamate synthase, encoded by the &lt;i&gt;argA&lt;/i&gt; gene. The acetyl donor for this reaction is acetyl-CoA.  &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-glutamate is then converted in three enzymatic steps to a second key intermediate, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-L-ornithine.  In the fifth step the acetyl group is then hydrolytically removed by the enzyme acetylornithine deacetylase encoded by the &lt;i&gt;argE&lt;/i&gt; gene, producing acetate and the L-arginine precursor L-ornithine.  L-ornithine is combined with carbamoyl-phosphate to form L-citrulline, which is converted in two steps to L-arginine.  Carbamoyl-phosphate is also a precursor in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: PWY0-162|).    The last three steps complete the assembly of the guanidino group of L-arginine from carbamoyl-phosphate and the amino group of L-aspartate.  Pathway enzyme regulation occurs via L-arginine feedback inhibition of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglutamate synthase, and via allosteric activation of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase by L-ornithine.  Allosteric inhibition of this enzyme by uridine 5'-phosphate balances the distribution of carbamoyl-phosphate in the arginine and pyrimidine biosynthetic pathways.  A molecular kinetic model for arginine biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; that was supported by experimental measurements has been developed.  The model took into account the complex genetic and metabolic regulatory network including &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine biosynthesis |CITS: [18165237]|].  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; L-arginine is not only utilized in protein synthesis, but also as a precursor for the polyamines putrescine and subsequently spermidine (see |FRAME: PWY-40| and the pathway link).  This putrescine pathway is used when L-arginine concentrations are high enough to inhibit L-ornithine synthesis, which prevents the conversion of L-ornithine to putrescine (as in |FRAME: PWY-46|) (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Phospholipids are important components of the inner and outer membranes of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Most phospholipids are |FRAME: Phosphoglycerides &quot;phosphoglycerides&quot;|. The simplest phosphoglycerides, which are known as |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE| (a phosphatidate), are composed of a glycerol molecule attached to two fatty acids and one phosphate group. The carboxyl group of each fatty acid is esterified to the hydroxyl groups on C-1 and C-2 of the glycerol molecule, while the phosphate group is attached to C-3 by an ester link.  Most of the fatty acids of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are contained in phospholipids. The three main phospholipids of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are  phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin. Phosphatidylethanolamine comprises about 75% of the total phospholipid, with the latter two varying as to growth phase. Trace amounts of other phospholipids including monoacylphosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylserine are also present.  The fatty acid composition of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; phospholipids consists of palmitate, myristate, palmitoleate, and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate, with trace amounts of laurate, stearate, and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-7-tetradecenoate. The proportions depend upon both growth phase and temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids rises with decreasing temperature, which is thought to maintain membrane fluidity.  Following the synthesis of the fatty acid components of phospholipids (see pathways under class |FRAME: Fatty-acid-biosynthesis|), they are transferred to a phosphorylated glycerol molecule (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|). The resulting |FRAME: L-PHOSPHATIDATE &quot;1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate&quot;| is then converted to its activated derivative |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. Following activation, it can then be modified to form other phsophoglycerides as shown in the pathway links.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  This pathway describes the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL| utilizing the PlsB and PlsC enzymes. It is found in some Gram-negative bacteria, primarily the |FRAME: TAX-1236|, including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. When cells are grown on carbon sources other than glycerol, the first step of phospholipid biosynthesis is the NADH-dependent reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (a glycolytic intermediate) to &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) catalyzed by |FRAME: GLYC3PDEHYDROGBIOSYN-CPLX|, the product of gene |FRAME: EG20091|. The enzyme is feedback-regulated by G3P which maintains a constant intracellular concentration of this metabolite |CITS: [6985897]|. When cells are grown on glycerol, |FRAME: GLYCEROL-KIN-CPLX| can produce G3P.  The production of the intermediate 1-acyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate is catalyzed by membrane-bound PlsB (|FRAME: GLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|) using an acyl-[acp] as the acyl donor. It transfers fatty acids (in the form of their acyl-[acp] products of fatty acid biosynthesis) to position 1 of G3P. PlsB enzymes can also utilize long-chain acyl-CoA thioesters as acyl donors (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5667|).  The addition of the second fatty acid acyl moiety at position 2 of G3P is catalyzed by PlsC (|FRAME: 1-ACYLGLYCEROL-3-P-ACYLTRANSFER-MONOMER|), producing a 1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate (a phosphatidate, phosphatidic acid). This enzyme is universally expressed in all bacteria. As in the case of PlsB, it can utilize either an acyl-[acp] or a long-chain acyl-CoA thioester as the acyl donor.  The PlsB/PlsC system thus intercepts the acyl-[acp] products of the fatty acid elongation cycle and transfers the acyl chains from the acyl-[acp] to either the C-1 or C-2 position of G3P, producing 1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate, the universal phospholipid precursor in bacteria. These enzymes are therefore key regulators of fatty acid and phospholipid synthesis.  The |FRAME: ACYL-SN-GLYCEROL-3P &quot;1,2-diacyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate&quot;| formed by PlsC is then converted to its activated form |FRAME: CDPDIACYLGLYCEROL|. This compound is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of all membrane phospholipids (as indicated in the pathway links and superpathway |FRAME: PHOSLIPSYN-PWY|).  It should be noted that most bacteria utilize a different route for the synthesis of 1-acyl-&lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol-3-phosphate that involves genes &lt;i&gt;plsX&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;plsY&lt;/i&gt;, as described in MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5981| |CITS: [16949372]|.

The latter compound is a precursor of di-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;,poly-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl phosphate, which leads to the biosynthesis of cell wall polymers (see below).  Review:  |CITS: [17442674]|  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12  (2&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate is formed by the joining of geranyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate in a reaction catalyzed by |FRAME: FPPSYN-MONOMER| encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;ispA&lt;/i&gt;, as shown in the pathway link.  In the pathway shown here, multiple units of isopentenyl diphosphate are polymerized to form di-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;,octa-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl diphosphate in a series of sequential condensation reactions catalyzed by undecaprenyl diphosphate synthase encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;ispU&lt;/i&gt;.    Subsequent polymerizations are carried out by other enzymes, depending on the configuration of the isoprenoid compound being formed.  Additions to (2&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate in the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; configuration are catalyzed by |FRAME: UPPSYN-CPLX| as described in this pathway.  Additions in the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; configuration are catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7426| encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;ispB&lt;/i&gt; leading to the synthesis of ubiquinol-8 and menaquinol-8 (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5783|).  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12, di-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;,octa-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl diphosphate is dephosphorylated to form di-&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;,octa-&lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl phosphate (as reviewed in the EcoSal citation below).

    <attribute name="description" value="tRNAs are the molecular adapters that allow the synthesis of proteins based on mRNAs transcribed from protein-coding genes. The active form of tRNA is generated by a combination of nuclease-based processing, the modification of select nucleosides, and finally charging via the |FRAME: TRNA-CHARGING-PWY|.  tRNA processing is a multi-step pathway carried out by a mix of endonucleases and exonucleases. Processing begins with the endonucleolytic cleavage of individual tRNA precursors from RNAs containing multiple tRNAs. This initial cleavage can generate precursor molecules with a long 5' trailing end or with a short 5' extension. Precursors with a long trailer require additional exonucleolytic processing before the other nucleases in the pathway can act.  Following this initial processing step, a suite of ribonucleases cut down the 5' and 3' ends to yield the final, processed tRNA.  Although this processing pathway can function with as a few as one of its constituent exonucleases, the final tRNA product may be &quot;imperfect,&quot; with a 3' end that may be longer or shorter than normal."/>

Additional isoprenoid units are added to a maximal length that is determined by each specific enzyme. Most organisms generate polyprenyl chains of predominantly one length. Once completed, the polyprenyl chain is incorporated into other molecules such as quinones. The enzyme that attaches the polyprenyl chain to the quinone precursor molecule does not have a preference for a particular length. Thus, the length of the polyprenyl chain in the mature quinone is determined by the predominant polyprenyl diphosphate synthase enzyme of the organism.  In most organisms there is one predominant type of quinone with a specific polyprenyl chain length. However, they also have minor amounts of quinones with a different polyprenyl chain length. Quinones containing chains of eight prenyl units are found in all kingdoms of life. They are particularly common among the Archaea and the Enterobacteriaceae.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 the initial addition of two isoprenyl units to form (2&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;,6&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;)-farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is catalyzed by |FRAME: FPPSYN-MONOMER|, encoded by gene |FRAME: EG10508| as shown in pathway |FRAME: PWY-5123|.

The latter compound constitutes tthe side chain of the three major isoprenoid quinones, ubiquinone, demethylmenaquinone, and menaquinone.

    <attribute name="description" value="The pathway of biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids branches from the pathway leading to saturated fatty acids at |FRAME: Beta-hydroxydecanoyl-ACPs|. Two dehydratases, FabA and FabZ, function for the most part interchangeably in converting |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP| of various chain lengths, saturated or unsaturated, to the corresponding |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP| unsaturated forms.

Instead it serves directly as a substrate for the condensing enzyme, FabB, and the subsequent three reactions shown here that lengthen the chain by two carbon atoms. As might be predicted, mutant strains unable to produce active FabA are unable to make unsaturated fatty acids, but make a normal complement of saturated fatty acids.  Repeated cycling of these four elongation reactions eventually lead to the unsaturated fatty acids, |FRAME: CPD-9245| and |FRAME: CPD-9247|, that are incorporated into various lipids. &lt;i&gt;E.coli&lt;/i&gt; produces greater amounts of |FRAME: CPD-9247| when grown at lower temperature.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can use the hexuronate D-galacturonate as the sole sources of carbon for growth.  The enzymes of this pathway were first described in a series of publications by Ashwell et al. |CITS: [13584413][13794771][14401695][13831814][13813474]|.  The initial step in the degradation of D-galacturonate is its isomerization to D-tagaturonate by D-galacturonate isomerase, an enzyme which can carry out the analogous function in the |FRAME: GLUCUROCAT-PWY| pathway.  D-tagaturonate then undergoes an NADH-dependent reduction to D-altronate by |FRAME: ALTRO-OXIDOREDUCT-MONOMER|.  |FRAME: ALTRODEHYDRAT-MONOMER| subsequently catalyzes dehydration to yield 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate.  At this point, the |FRAME: GLUCUROCAT-PWY| and |FRAME: GALACTUROCAT-PWY| pathways converge, and a common enzyme, |FRAME: DEOXYGLUCONOKIN-MONOMER|, phosphorylates 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate to yield 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate, which enters central metabolism via the |FRAME: ENTNER-DOUDOROFF-PWY|.

    <attribute name="description" value="The peptidoglycan (PG) or murein sacculus of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 is assembled from monomer subunits of the disaccharide pentapeptide, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&amp;gamma;-D-glutamyl-&lt;I&gt;meso&lt;/I&gt;-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (also known as GlcNAc-MurNAc-pentapeptide) which are synthesized in the cytoplasm as lipid linked molecules (lipid II) and then flipped across the inner membrane by a flippase protein (see |FRAME: PEPTIDOGLYCANSYN-PWY|). Mature peptidoglycan is assembled on the outer face of the inner membrane through the action of transglycosylases, transpeptidases and peptidoglycan hydrolases.   Peptidoglycan is a heterogeneous polymer; the length of mature glycan strands varies |CITS: [2285138][3292521]| - the average degree of oligomerization is about 25 to 40 disaccharide units |CITS: [17658458]| - and may be affected by growth conditions. The length of the peptide stem also varies - di-, tri-, tetra- and pentapeptide muropeptides have all been identified - as have different levels of cross-linkage from monomeric peptides to tetrameric peptides |CITS: [3292521]|. Growing glycan chains remain linked to the lipid carrier (&lt;i&gt;di-trans,octa-cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl phosphate); the terminal residues of released strands are GlcNAc and 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc |CITS: [357]| however the mechanism resulting in release remains unknown - lytic transglycosylases which cleave PG producing 1,6-anyhdroMurNAc muropeptides during PG recycling and turnover do not seem to be involved (see |CITS: [22126997]|.  Transglycosylases catalyse the formation of a &amp;beta;1 &amp;rarr; 4 N-acetylmuramoyl-N-acetylglucosamine bond between a growing glycan chain and a newly flipped disaccharide pentapeptide monomer releasing a molecule of &lt;i&gt;di-trans,octa-cis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyl diphosphate (UPP) for recycling in the process. It is not clear whether the growing glycan chain serves as glycosyl donor and the disaccharide monomer as acceptor or vice versa; evidence for the former has been presented (|CITS: [16351056]|). Transpeptidases cross link glycan strands within newly synthesized peptidoglycan and between newly made material and preexisting peptidoglycan; they also link peptidoglycan to Braun's lipoprotein (Lpp) in the outer membrane and catalyse the exchange of carboxy terminal D-alanine residues with glycine in the peptide stem.   DD-transpeptidases catalyse the cross-linking of the glycan strands between the the D-alanine at position 4 of a pentapeptide stem and the meso-diaminopimelyl residue (m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm) at position 3 of a separate tetrapeptide stem (a D-Ala &amp;rarr; m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm cross-link); LD transpeptidases catalyse the cross link between two m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm residues of separate stems. &lt;i&gt;E. coli K-12&lt;/i&gt; contains bifunctional transglycosylases/DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: CPLX0-7717 &quot;MrcA&quot;| also known as penicillin binding protein 1A or PBP1A, |FRAME: CPLX0-3951 &quot;MrcB&quot;|/PBP1B and |FRAME: G7322-MONOMER &quot;PbpC&quot;|/PBP1C) |CITS: [7006606][16840781][7001458][10542235]|, monofunctional DD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG10606-MONOMER &quot;MrdA&quot;|/PBP2, |FRAME: EG10341-MONOMER &quot;FtsI&quot;|/PBP3) |CITS: [6297485][3531167]|, a monofunctional transglycosylase (|FRAME: G7668-MONOMER &quot;MtgA&quot;|) |CITS: [8772200]| and 2 LD transpeptidases (|FRAME: EG11253-MONOMER &quot;LdtD&quot;| and |FRAME: G6904-MONOMER &quot;LdtE&quot;|) which form m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm &amp;rarr; m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm cross links within peptidoglycan |CITS: [18456808]|.  A further three LD-transpeptidases (|FRAME: G7073-MONOMER &quot;LdtA&quot;|, |FRAME: G6571-MONOMER &quot;LdtC&quot;| and |FRAME: G6422-MONOMER &quot;LdtB&quot;|) cleave the m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm-d-Ala peptide bond of a peptidoglycan donor stem and link the m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm residue to the the C-terminal lysine residue of Braun's lipoprotein and catalyse the exchange of D-alanine with glycine in tetrapeptide stems |CITS: [17369299][18456808]|.     The murein of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 is characterised by the presence of 'free' penta-, tetra-, and tripeptide stems (ie. stems not involved in cross linkages) in varying proportions. Pentapeptide stems are converted to tetrapeptides by the action of DD carboxypeptidases (primarily |FRAME: EG10201-MONOMER &quot;DacA or PBP5&quot;|) which remove the C-terminal D-alanine residue |CITS: [7002918]| while tripeptide stems are formed by cleavage of the (L)-&lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm &amp;rarr;D-Ala bond of tetrapeptide stems. This latter reaction is catalysed by the LD-transpeptidase enzymes (LdtA, LdtB, LdtC, LdtD and LdtE) which also have LD-carboxypeptidase activity |CITS: [18456808]|. The amount of dipeptide subunits in isolated murein is low and the mechanism by which they might be formed is not clear.  Please note: This pathway has been designed to include many of the reactions that are involved during the assembly of nascent peptidoglycan but the heterogeneous nature of the mature polymer precludes depiction by a single pathway. This pathway does not depict the insertion of newly made peptidoglycan into the existing sacculus - several models for this process have been proposed (see |CITS: [17658458]|). The insertion of new material requires cleavage of mature peptidoglycan and &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; contains a variety of peptidoglycan hydrolases which cleave the glycoside and amide bonds of mature peptidoglycan (reviewed in |CITS: [22126997]|). There is a significant turnover of peptidoglycan during cell growth and this is accompanied by recycling of the turnover products for reuse (see |FRAME: PWY0-1261| and |FRAME: PWY0-1546|).

UMP can subsequently be converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in this pathway.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Uridine-5'-phosphate (UMP) is converted to UDP and then to UTP by two kinase reactions.  The first is a specific kinase encoded by &lt;i&gt;pyrH&lt;/i&gt; and the second is a nonspecific kinase encoded by &lt;i&gt;ndk&lt;/i&gt;.  CTP is synthesized from UTP in an amination reaction involving CTP synthetase, a glutamine amidotransferase encoded by &lt;i&gt;pyrG&lt;/i&gt;.  Uridylate kinase (UMP kinase) controls the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of other pyrimidine nucleotides.  The &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme is highly regulated by UTP inhibition and GTP activation.  Feedback inhibition by UTP is important for an optimal response to nutritional conditions such as growth on orotate |CITS: [23903661]|.  Bacterial UMP kinases are potential targets for drug development due their differing specificity and structure from animal CMP/UMP kinases |CITS: [19071117]|.  CTP synthetase is also highly regulated and is of interest as a drug target |CITS: [18003612]|.  In enteric bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are scattered on the chromosome and may be a single transcriptional unit or part of a small operon.  They have their own regulatory mechanisms and are not regulated by a common repressor.    Review: Jensen, K.F., G. Dandanell, B. Hove-Jensen and M.

It is probably second only to ATP in the variety of reactions for which it serves as a cofactor.  SAM is found in all living organisms, and fulfills three important roles:  *  In transmethylation, SAM is the principal biological methyl donor.  *  In transsulfuration, the sulfur atom of the SAM molecule is converted via a series of enzymatic steps to cysteine, a precursor of taurine and glutathione, a major cellular anti-oxidant.  *  In polyamine biosynthesis, SAM is the donor of aminopropyl groups.  The structure of SAM was first elucidated by Cantoni in 1951 |CITS: [14832232]|.  The key to SAM's activity lies in the presence of the high energy sulfonium ion, which activates each of the attached carbons toward nucleophilic attack.  In most cases, SAM reacts by transfer of the S-methyl group to a long list of possible acceptors in transmethylation reactions.  SAM is synthesized in the cytosol of every cell from |FRAME: MET| and |FRAME: ATP|; in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the reaction is catalyzed by |FRAME: S-ADENMETSYN-CPLX|.  In this unusual reaction, the adenosyl moiety of ATP is transferred to methionine, forming a sulfonium ion which is a high energy reagent that can easily transfer its methyl group to a large variety of acceptor substrates including nucleic acids, proteins, phospholipids, biologic amines, and a long list of small molecules |CITS: [10762064]|."/>

Despite the importance and prevalance of biotin, its detailed biosynthetic pathway remained enigmatic for over 70 years. The first complete pathway for biotin synthesis was suggested for its synthesis in E. coli |CITS: [20693992]|.  Biotin consists of two fused heterocyclic rings and a |FRAME: VALERATE| side chain, derived from a |FRAME: CPD-205|-like structure. The early steps of the pathway describe the synthesis of the precursor pimelate, and are described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6519|. The late steps of the pathway, which are responsible for forming the two rings in the structure of biotin, are described here.  The first step in this part of the pathway involves the unusual use of the common methyl-group donor |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| as an amino-group donor, a reaction catalyzed by the |FRAME: EG10117|-encoded |FRAME: DAPASYN-CPLX| |CITS: [1092681][1092682][12379100]|. This product of this reaction, |FRAME: DIAMINONONANOATE|, is the target of a unique carboxylase, the |FRAME: EG10120|-encoded |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|. This enzye catalyzes the first ring closure by a carboxylation reaction that does not require biotin as a prosthetic group, forming |FRAME: DETHIOBIOTIN| |CITS: [4921568]|.  The ultimate step in the pathway is catalyzed by |FRAME: BIOTIN-SYN-CPLX|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10118|. This enzyme inserts a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 of dethiobiotin in a |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE|-dependent reaction.

These entwined pathways are part of the |FRAME:BRANCHED-CHAIN-AA-SYN-PWY|, that generates not only isoleucine and valine, but also leucine.  As a consequence of having several of its component enzymes involved in the synthesis of three different amino acids, the pathway of isoleucine biosynthesis is subject to regulation by all three amino acids. The first step in the pathway is primarily inhibited by valine, along with inhibition by isoleucine and leucine. The potential disruption this might cause to the parallel isoleucine biosynthesis pathway step using the same enzymes is resolved by upregulation of an earlier step that is unique to isoleucine biosynthesis, as explained in the |FRAME:ILEUSYN-PWY| summary.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  It is well known that &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; can use glucose as a sole source of carbon and energy.  The D isomer of glucose is widely found in nature and the &amp;beta;-D-glucose anomer is predominant in aqueous solution |CITS: [FRANKS87]|.  Exogenous &amp;beta;-D-glucose enters the cell through outer membrane porins and is then actively transported into the cell via the inner membrane phosphotransferase system (PTS) which transforms it into &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate as it crosses the cell membrane.  &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is also produced biosynthetically during gluconeogenesis.  &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate is one of the basic precursor metabolites for biosynthetic pathways.  It is also a substrate for the central degradative pathways glycolysis and the pentose phosphate cycle.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can also grow on exogenously supplied glucose-1-phosphate (minimal medium containing glucose 1-phosphate) as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]|.  Endogenous &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is an intermediate in the metabolism of glycogen and galactose.  It is a building block for the sugar nucleotide UDP-glucose, which is used in some biosynthetic pathways.   Reviewed by Mayer, C. and W. Boos in |CITS: [ecosal]| (see below).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The dashed line connecting D-glucose with &amp;beta;-D-glucose is meant to show that the pathway is possible, but incompletely defined.  The anomeric form (&amp;alpha; or &amp;beta;) of the D-glucose product of EC 3.1.3.10 is not specified by the EC and it was not found in the literature for the indicated phosphatases.  However, if &amp;alpha;-D-glucose is produced, it may either spontaneously convert to &amp;beta;-D-glucose, or &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; aldose-1-epimerase (mutarotase, EC 5.1.3.3) could convert it to &amp;beta;-D-glucose |CITS: [7966338]| and in |CITS: [4711601]|.  Substrates &amp;beta;-D-glucose and &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate may be derived from exogenous sources, or endogenously produced, as indicated by the input pathway links.  In general, the ability to utilize sugars and their modes of utilization are strain-dependent in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Exogenous &amp;beta;-D-glucose uptake via the PTS curbs the utilization of other exogenous sugars, which is known as the glucose effect.  This effect is lost if &amp;beta;-D-glucose becomes limiting.  Under these conditions &amp;beta;-D-glucose can also enter the cell without phosphorylation, via outer membrane porins and the Mgl ABC transporter (not shown).  Endogenous &amp;beta;-D-glucose can be produced by pathways for the degradation of glucose-containing disaccharides such as maltose (see pathway |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|) trehalose, lactose and melibiose, as shown in the pathway links.  In contrast to exogenous &amp;beta;-D-glucose  which is phosphorylated by the PTS, endogenous &amp;beta;-D-glucose is phosphorylated by glucokinase before entering central metabolism, as shown in the pathway links (in |CITS: [9023215]|).  More recently, a role for glucokinase and glucose in a complex regulatory mechanism for maltose utilization involving Glk, MalT, Mlc and PtsG has been proposed |CITS: [19028900]|.  It is possible that high levels of &amp;beta;-D-glucose could accumulate inside the cell under certain conditions.  It has been shown that the maltose acetyltransferase product of gene &lt;i&gt;maa&lt;/i&gt; efficiently acetylates both maltose and &amp;beta;-D-glucose (not shown).  Evidence suggests that acetylation could be a detoxification mechanism in which acetylated &amp;beta;-D-glucose diffuses from the cell |CITS: [7012137] [1856235]|.   There is evidence that &amp;beta;-D-glucose can be oxidized to glucono-&amp;delta;-lactone (glucono-1,5-lactone) by inner membrane glucose dehydrogenase.  However, the fate of the glucono-&amp;delta;-lactone remains unclear.  It has been reported that membrane vesicles from glucose-grown &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; oxidized glucose to gluconate in the presence of pyrrolo-quinoline quinone, a cofactor for glucose dehydrogenase |CITS: [3926746]|.  A gluconolactonase (EC 3.1.1.17) has been partially characterized in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, but its D-gluconate product was not specifically identified |CITS: [4625870]| and no gene encoding this enzyme has been identified.  D-gluconate can be degraded by a glucose utilization pathway that was described early |CITS: [14882337]|, as shown in the pathway link.  In addition, more recent work suggested possible excretion of D-gluconate although this compound was not specifically identified |CITS: [20215780]|.  &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is reversibly converted by phosphoglucomutase to &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate.  &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate is used in glycogen biosynthesis (see |FRAME: GLYCOGENSYNTH-PWY|) and is produced during glycogen degradation (see |FRAME: GLYCOCAT-PWY|).  &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-6-phosphate may spontaneously convert to &amp;beta;-D-glucose-6-phosphate in the physiological pH range |CITS: [14275652]|.  In addition, a glucose-6-phosphate 1-epimerase had been identified in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATCC 9637 that could catalyze this production of &amp;beta;-D-glucose 6-phosphate.  Several phosphatases may catalyze the production of D-glucose (anomeric form unspecified) from &amp;alpha;-D-glucose-1-phosphate.  The product of gene &lt;i&gt;agp&lt;/i&gt; is a periplasmic enzyme that scavenges glucose and allows &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; to grow with glucose-1-phosphate as sole carbon source |CITS: [1648777]| and in |CITS: [12782623]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Microorganisms and mammals share two of the major, initial routes for threonine degradation.  In the first route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREDEHYDCAT-CPLX| (EC 4.3.1.19) to ammonia and 2-oxobutanoate.  A biosynthetic version of this enzyme also occurs (see |FRAME:THREDEHYDSYN-CPLX|) |CITS: [13405870]|.  In the second route threonine is catabolized by |FRAME:THREODEHYD-CPLX| (EC 1.1.1.103) to form 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate, which is mainly cleaved by |FRAME: AKBLIG-CPLX|, forming glycine and acetyl-CoA. The 2-amino-3-oxobutanoate can also be spontaneously converted to aminoacetone, which may be further metabolized to methylglyoxal (see |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  A third route has been demonstrated in several bacteria and fungi.  This route is based on the enzyme |FRAME:LTAA-CPLX| (EC 4.1.2.5), which cleaves threonine directly into glycine and acetaldehyde.  &lt;i&gt;Escherichia. coli&lt;/i&gt; has been shown to assimilate nitrogen from some (but not all) amino acids, as well as agmatine, &amp;gamma;-aminobutyrate and the polyamines putrescine and spermidine.  These nitrogen sources are used to generate glutamate and glutamine, the major intracellular nitrogen donors.  Some nitrogen sources, such as aspartate, can generate glutamate by transamination (see |FRAME: ASPAMINOTRANS-DIMER|).  Others, such as proline and arginine, produce glutamate as end products (glutamate generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I| and |FRAME: AST-PWY|).  Other nitrogen sources, such as serine, require ammonia production for glutamate synthesis (ammonia generating amino acids) (see |FRAME: SERDEG-PWY|).  Ammonia generation is required for glutamine synthesis (see |FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|).  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; a low intracellular level of ammonia results in low intracellular glutamine and induction of the nitrogen-regulated (Ntr) response that involves response regulators |FRAME: GLNG-CPLX| and |FRAME: GLNL-CPLX|.  The Ntr response functions in ammonia assimilation, nitrogen scavenging and metabolic coordination.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has three systems that can transport threonine:  |FRAME: YGJU-MONOMER| |CITS: [12097162]|, |FRAME: ABC-15-CPLX| |CITS: [4583203]|, and |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| |CITS: [2115866]|.  Although &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can use threonine, glycine, or serine as a nitrogen source, efficient serine or threonine utilization requires amino acid supplementation.  Leucine supplementation is required for the use of threonine as a nitrogen source in pathways utilizing |FRAME: THREODEHYD-CPLX| (TDH) which is induced by leucine |CITS: [334738]| (see |FRAME: THREONINE-DEG2-PWY| and |FRAME: THRDLCTCAT-PWY|).  TDH is is a major route for threonine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  A minor pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5436| and an anaerobic pathway is shown in |FRAME: PWY-5437|.

Both enzymes convert threonine to 2-oxobutanoate.   While the biosynthetic enzyme is involved in isoleucine biosynthesis (see |FRAME: ILEUSYN-PWY|), the catabolic enzyme participates in the degradation of threonine to propionate in a pathway that generates ATP and enables the utilization of threonine as a sole source of carbon and energy |CITS: [4370904]|. This &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; anaerobic threonine dehydratase pathway is shown here |CITS: [9871012][9484901]|.  The first reaction in this pathway is catalyzed by catabolic threonine dehydratase which degrades threonine to 2-oxobutanoate (&amp;alpha;-ketobutyrate) and ammonia.  The 2-oxobutanoate then undergoes lyase cleavage with the addition of coenzyme A to form propanoyl-CoA and formate.  Two such lyases were discovered in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 |CITS: [9484901]|.  Both of these enzymes, |FRAME:PYRUVFORMLY-CPLX| encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;pflB&lt;/i&gt; and |FRAME: KETOBUTFORMLY-MONOMER| encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;tdcE&lt;/i&gt;, are expressed only under anaerobic conditions, and both utilize a glycyl radical as part of their catalytic mechanism |CITS:[9767563]|.  TdcE is equally active with 2-oxobutanoate and pyruvate substrates, whereas PflB prefers pyruvate.  Once propanoyl-CoA is formed, it is processed via propionyl-phosphate to propionate in a reaction sequence that produces ATP.  Acetate kinase AckA can also utilize propionate as a substrate in the final reaction.  The enzymes in this pathway are also able to process L-serine, with pyruvate as the final product |CITS: [9871012]|.  Features of this energy-generating pathway include substrate-level phosphorylation, a requirement for cAMP-CRP, and catabolite repression.  The &lt;i&gt;tdc&lt;/i&gt;ABCDEFG operon genes also encode |FRAME: TDCC-MONOMER| (see above), |FRAME: CPLX0-7622|, and |FRAME: G7626-MONOMER|.

It is important for the synthesis of cellular glycine in yeast |CITS: [9163906]|, but not in wild-type &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [9692922]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, if the major glycine biosynthetic pathway is disrupted by a &lt;i&gt;glyA&lt;/i&gt; mutation, |FRAME: LTAA-CPLX| may provide an alternative glycine biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [9692922]| (see |FRAME: GLYSYN-PWY|).  Although purified GlyA was also shown to cleave threonine, it did so at a very slow rate |CITS: [3891721]| (see |FRAME: GLYOHMETRANS-CPLX|).  Overall, the low-specificity L-threonine aldolase pathway is considered to be a minor pathway of threonine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  Review: Reitzer, L.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typically consist of a hydrophobic domain inserted into the outer membrane known as lipid A (or endotoxin), a phosphorylated &quot;core&quot; oligosaccharide and a distal polysaccharide (or O antigen). The core oligosaccharides are conceptually divided into two regions: inner core and outer core. The inner core is highly conserved, comprises three deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid (KDO) and L-glycero-D-manno-heptose (Hep) and is often phosphorylated. The inner core oligosaccharide plays a critical role in essential barrier function of the outer membrane. The outer core comprises a tri-hexose backbone modified with varying side-branch substitutions of hexose and acetamidohexose residues. The outer core provides an attachment site for O-antigen. Strains of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K12 normally do not make O-antigen, unless a mutation in the O-antigen operon is corrected |CITS: [7517391]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The completed lipid A-KDO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; serves as the acceptor on which the core oligosaccharide chains are assembled by sequential glycosyl transfer from nucleotide sugar precursors. This process involves a co-ordinated complex of membrane-associated glycosyltransferases acting at the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Many of the enzymes are predicted to be peripheral proteins.   &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; mutants that lack the heptose region of the inner core display &quot;deep rough&quot; phenotypes and causes instability of the outer membrane. These mutants lose expression of pili and flagella and secrete hemolysin with reduced activity. Mutations that eliminate synthesis of the outer core result in enhanced susceptibility to some hydrophobic compounds due to an indirect effect on core phosphorylation.

The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; with lower growth temperature. This phenomenon, found in most organisms, that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures.  |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| encoded by |FRAME: EG12606| is the only enzyme that can catalyze the conversion of |FRAME: CPD-9245| to |FRAME: CPD-9247|, and is believed to play a major role in the thermal regulation of fatty acid composition of the membrane phospholipids of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [6988423]|. |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is one of three &amp;beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS) in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;: |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.  It has been shown that |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of |FRAME: CPD-9247| rather than |FRAME: CPD-9245|. Furthermore, because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of diunsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The first step in the biosynthesis of |FRAME: CPD-9247| from |FRAME: CPD-9245| is elongation from C&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; to C&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; with formation of a 3-oxo group, catalyzed by the product of |FRAME: EG12606|. The next three steps then complete the elongation cycle. These include reduction of the 3-oxo group, dehydration to form the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-2-enoyl-ACP |FRAME: cis-vaccen-2-enoyl-ACPs|, and reduction of the resulting 2,3 double bond to form the acyl-ACP, |FRAME: Cis-vaccenoyl-ACPs|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Fatty acids are key building blocks for the phospholipid components of cell membranes. Palmitate is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in microorganisms, plants and animals. It was discovered by Edmond Fremy in 1840 in saponified palm oil, of which it is a major component, and hence its name.  Palmitate is synthesized by stepwise condensation of C2 units to a growing acyl chain. Each elongation cycle results in the addition of two carbons to the acyl chain, and consists of four separate reactions. The first step is the condensation of a C2 unit with the nascent [acyl carrier protein]-bound acyl (acyl-[acp]) forming a |FRAME: B-KETOACYL-ACP| and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This step is followed by reduction to |FRAME: OH-ACYL-ACP|, dehydration to |FRAME: TRANS-D2-ENOYL-ACP|, and a final reduction to form the elongated fatty acyl-[acp]. This chain of event repeats itself several times, until the final product, |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|, is formed.  There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis systems, named type I and type II. The type I system is found in animals and lower eukaryotes (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5994|). The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid, while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex.  The type II systems are found in bacteria and plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the Apicomplexa phylum |CITS: [17112527]|, and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of |FRAME: ACP|.  Unlike the type I system that accepts |FRAME:MALONYL-COA| as the source of the two-carbon units, the type II systems accept only |FRAME: MALONYL-ACP|. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the final product of this pathway is |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|. In some bacteria and plants, but not &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the acyl moiety is released from the [acyl carrier protein] by an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14 or EC 3.1.2.21) |CITS: [22112270][1989513]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;   This pathway is an instance of the generalized fatty acid elongation pathway depicted in |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY|. It shows the elongation of |FRAME: Acetoacetyl-ACPs| produced by the fatty acid biosynthesis initiation reactions (shown in |FRAME: FASYN-INITIAL-PWY|) to produce |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs|.  As noted above, the final product of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; pathway is |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs|. &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; lacks an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] hydrolase (EC 3.1.2.14) that releases |FRAME: PALMITATE| from |FRAME: Palmitoyl-ACPs|. Instead, the acyl chain of |FRAME:Palmitoyl-ACPs| is transferred into membrane phospholipids by a &lt;i&gt;sn&lt;/i&gt;-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase system (see pathway |FRAME: PWY0-1319|).

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  L-fucose is an important monosaccharide found in a diverse array of organisms. It is a carbohydrate component of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, mammalian and plant glycoproteins and various plant cell wall polysaccharides. Fucosylation is performed by fucosyltransferases which require the activated form GDP-L-fucose as the donor substrate. The formation of GDP-L-fucose occurs via two routes, a &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis route from GDP-&amp;alpha;-D-mannose (this pathway), and a eukaryotic salvage pathway leading to the formation of UDP-fucose from free L-fucose (see |FRAME:PWY-6|).    The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesis of GDP-L-fucose from GDP-D-mannose comprises three catalytic steps: a 4,6-dehydration, a 3,5-epimerization, and a 4-reduction. The first reaction step is catalyzed by |FRAME: GDPMANDEHYDRA-CPLX|, which involves the formation of the intermediate GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose. This compound is also a common intermediate in the synthesis of other bacterial deoxyhexoses derived from GDP-D-mannose (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: PWY-5738| |FRAME: PWY-5739| |FRAME: GDPRHAMSYN-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-5740|). In bacteria (including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;), fungi, plants and humans, the second and third reactions have been shown to be catalyzed by a single bifunctional polypeptide, GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[12881408][9525924][8910301][20035716]|.  In the Enterobacteriaceae colanic acid (M antigen) is a polyanionic extracellular heteropolysaccharide containing a repeat unit with D-glucose, L-fucose, D-galactose, and D-glucuronate sugars that are nonstoichiometrically decorated with &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl and pyruvate side chains |CITS: [4902806 ][4941627]|. The sugars must be activated in the form of nucleotide sugars (such as |FRAME: GUANOSINE_DIPHOSPHATE_FUCOSE|) before their assembly |CITS: [8759852] [8763957]| (see pathway COLANSYN-PWY). Colanic acid biosynthesis has been linked to a cluster of 19 &lt;i&gt;wca&lt;/i&gt; genes that includes &lt;i&gt;wcaG&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;fcl&lt;/i&gt;) encoding GDP-fucose synthase |CITS:[8759852][9473059]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  L-fucose is biosynthesized as the sugar nucleotide GDP-L-fucose. Its biosynthesis from GDP-D-mannose begins with dehydration of this compound to GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose by the product of gene &lt;i&gt;gmd&lt;/i&gt;. Then the bifunctional GDP-fucose synthase catalyzes the two-step (epimerase/reductase) synthesis of GDP-fucose from GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose via a GDP-4-dehydro-6-L-deoxygalactose intermediate |CITS: [9473059]|. The overall reaction is defined by EC 1.1.1.271 and is carried out at a single active site on the enzyme |CITS: [19053199]|.  This pathway requires NADPH as a reducing cofactor. Overexpression of endogenous NADPH-regenerating enzymes in recombinant &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; increased GDP-L-fucose production under optimized conditions |CITS: [21538115]|. In another study, overexpression of |FRAME: CPLX0-322| encoded by gene &lt;i&gt;gsk&lt;/i&gt; led to a significant improvement of GDP-L-fucose production. This was attributed to the increased level of intracellular GMP as a source of GTP which is required for this pathway (as shown in the pathway link to |FRAME: PWY-5659|) |CITS: [22159740]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q) is an isoprenoid quinone that functions as an electron carrier in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and most other Gram-negative facultative anaerobes it is one of three major isoprenoid quinones along with demethylmenaquinone and menaquinone (see pathways |FRAME: PWY-5852| and |FRAME: MENAQUINONESYN-PWY|). Each quinone is required for respiration using different, but overlapping subsets of final electron acceptors. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the quinone nucleus of ubiquinone is derived directly from 4-hydroxybenzoate, while the isoprenoid subunits of the polyisoprenoid tail are originally derived from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway (as indicated in the pathway links).  The number of isoprenoid subunits in the ubiquinone side chain varies in different species. The number is determined by the specific polyprenyl diphosphate synthase (see |FRAME: CPLX0-7426|). For example, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 ubiquinone contains eight isoprenoid units, &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; six, rat and mouse nine, and humans ten. The ubiquinones are often named according to either the number of carbons in the side chain (e.g. ubi-30) or the number of isoprenoid subunits (e.g. Q-10).  Following addition of the polyprenyl tail, the 4-hydroxy-3-polyprenylbenzoate product is processed by decarboxylation, oxidation, and methylation. The prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathways differ in the order of these steps. In prokaryotes the compound is first decarboxylated, followed by oxidation and methylation. In eukaryotes the compound is oxidized and methylated prior to decarboxylation |CITS: [Shepherd96]|.  The ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway has been elucidated primarily by the use of mutant strains that accumulate pathway intermediates. However some of the enzymes in this pathway have not been biochemically characterized.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The best studied ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway is that of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12, which produces ubiquinone-8. The first committed step of the pathway is the conversion of chorismate to 4-hydroxybenzoate by |FRAME: CHORPYRLY-MONOMER| (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-5755|). The enzyme retains and is efficiently inhibited by the product of the reaction, 4-hydroxybenzoate, which may be a control mechanism for the ubiquinone biosynthesis pathway or a mechanism for delivery of 4-hydroxybenzoate to the membrane |CITS: [11455603][11825618]|.  The second step in the pathway is the transfer of the polyisoprenoid tail onto 4-hydroxybenzoate by the membrane-bound |FRAME: 4OHBENZOATE-OCTAPRENYLTRANSFER-MONOMER| as shown in this pathway. This is followed by the decarboxylation of the ring structure by |FRAME: CPLX0-301| (or possibly by UbiX) to form 2-octaprenylphenol.  Under anaerobic conditions, this compound accumulates in the membrane and is not converted into ubiquinone. Further steps in the pathway require the presence of dioxygen |CITS: [361395]|.  Subsequent steps also involve the alternating introduction of three hydroxyl and three methyl groups. With the exception of the UbiG methyltransferase that catalyzes both of the &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-methyltransferase reactions, few of the enzymes have been studied biochemically and their substrate and cofactor requirements are still unknown. The enzymes of this pathway may form a membrane-associated multienzyme complex |CITS: [393264]|. UbiX shows a genetic interaction with UbiG, suggesting a possible physical interaction within a complex |CITS: [16923914]|.  The product of this pathway is shown as ubiquinol, the fully reduced form of ubiquinone. It is present in the cytoplasmic membrane (see the electron transfer pathways listed under |FRAME: AEROBIC-RESPIRATION|).  Reviews: |CITS: [11583838]| and Meganathan, R. and O.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Methionine can be biosynthesized by microorganisms and plants, although mammals cannot biosynthesize methionone &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;.  Methionine is required for many important cellular functions.  It is a basic building block of proteins and is required for the initiation of protein synthesis (via &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-formyl-L- methionine).  Methionine is also used in the synthesis of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-L-methionine which is the major methyl group donor in cellular metabolism.  &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-L-methionine is also utilized in pathways such as |FRAME: PWY-6153| and |FRAME: BSUBPOLYAMSYN-PWY|.  Some bacteria including &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; synthesize methionine using organic sulfur through transsulfuration of &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acylated homoserine with cysteine to form cystathionine.  Cystathionine is then cleaved to homocysteine, and methylated to methionine as shown in this pathway |CITS: [3309561]|.  Other bacteria, yeast and fungi can use a different route in which they directly assimilate inorganic sulfur by a sulfhydrylation (see MetaCyc pathways |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-5344| and |FRAME:HSERMETANA-PWY|).  While many organisms seem to contain both routes for methionine biosynthesis, in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; and other enteric bacteria only the transsulfuration pathway is used.  Reviewed in Greene, R.C. (1996) &quot;Biosynthesis of Methionine&quot; in |CITS: [COLISAL]| pp. 542-560).  The &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-acyl group of homoserine is  a succinyl group in enteric bacteria and some other Gram-negative bacteria, such as &lt;i&gt;Pseudomanas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas putida&lt;/i&gt;.  It is an acetyl group in fungi, yeast, and most Gram-positive bacteria (|CITS: [10482527][3309561][9409150]|).  In both routes homocysteine is methylated to methionine via either a cobalamin-independent enzyme, or a cobalamin-dependent enzyme, depending upon the species or growth conditions |CITS: [12948640][9409150]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis of methionine is an energy-costly process involving inputs from several other pathways.  The carbon skeleton of methionine is derived from aspartate (see pathway |FRAME: HOMOSERSYN-PWY |).  The sulfur is derived from cysteine (see pathway |FRAME: CYSTSYN-PWY|) which derives its sulfur from sulfate assimilation (see pathway |FRAME: SO4ASSIM-PWY|).  The methyl group is derived from serine via one-carbon metabolism (see pathways |FRAME: 1CMET2-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY-2161|).  Methionine is also converted to &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-L-methionine, a methyl group donor, by the product of gene &lt;i&gt;metK&lt;/i&gt; (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6151|).  The main steps of methionine biosynthesis from homoserine are shown here.  Homoserine is first activated by &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-succinylation in a reaction catalyzed by MetA.  The product &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-succinyl-L-homoserine combines with cysteine to form cystathionine in a reaction catalyzed by MetB.  Lyase cleavage of cystathionine by MetC forms homocysteine.  This &amp;beta;-cystathionase activity can also be supplied by MalY as demonstrated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by the ability of constitutive MalY expression to complement &lt;i&gt;metC&lt;/i&gt; mutants auxotrophic for methionine |CITS: [7665481]|.  Homocysteine is subsequently methylated by either MetH or MetE to produce methionine.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; MetH can function only in the presence of exogenously supplied vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (cobalamin), which represses MetE expression.  B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; is likely to be available in the gut.  In the absence of exogenously supplied B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, MetE catalyzes this final step of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; methionine biosynthesis.  Although the pathway is largely regulated at the transcriptional level, feedback inhibition of the first enzyme homoserine &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;-succinyltransferase (MetA) by methionine and &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-adenosyl-L-methionine has been shown.  Under stressful conditions there is further regulation of the pathway enzymes.  Under heat-shock conditions growth is slowed due to the thermal instability of MetA.  Oxidative stress affects MetE which contains an oxidation-sensitive cysteine residue at position 645 near the active site.  Oxidation of methionone itself can also occur although the cell contains methionine sufloxide reductases MsrA and MsrB to combat this.  Weak organic acids also generate oxidative stress, with more complex effects.  Sulfur limitation depletes homocysteine which serves as a coactivator for MetR activation of MetE expression.   Due to the absence of this pathway in mammals, some of the bacterial biosynthetic enzymes are potential drug targets |CITS: [15155634]|.  In addition, although methionine is used as a food additive and a medication, its industrial scale production in microorganisms has not yet been achieved due to the complexity and strong regulation of its biosynthetic pathway |CITS: [15933025]|.

It is not found in the archaea |CITS: [12697167]|.  Prokaryotes can synthesize queuosine &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; by a complex biosynthetic pathway, whereas eukaryotes are unable to synthesize it, and utilize a salvage system, acquiring the |FRAME: QUEUINE| base as a nutrient factor from their diet or from intestinal microflora |CITS: [19925456 ]|.  Queuosine and its derivatives occur exclusively at position 34 (the wobble position) in the anticodons of tRNAs coding for the amino acids |FRAME: HIS|, |FRAME:L-ASPARTATE|, |FRAME: ASN| and |FRAME: TYR| |CITS: [ 4550561]|.  Each of these tRNAs posses the anticodon sequence GUN (positions 34-36), where N can be any nucleotide.  Queuosine improves accuracy of translation |CITS: [2988936][11532950]|.  These tRNAs of the 'Q-family' originally contain guanine in the first position of anticodon, which is post-transcriptionally modified with |FRAME: QUEUINE| by an irreversible insertion during maturation.   Beside the 7-deazaguanosine core, queuosine possesses an additional adaptation - a cyclopentenediol ring attached to an aminomethyl group at position 7.  The cyclopentendiol ring can be further modified by glutamylation (see |FRAME: EG11362-MONOMER|) |CITS: [16164993]|.  The first part of the pathway leading to formation of queuosine, up to the intermediate |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, is described in the pathway |FRAME: PWY-6703|.   |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE &quot;PreQ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;| is a common intermediate, and is also found in the pathways leading to the biosynthesis of several 7-deazapurine antibiotics produced by &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; species.  Before it can be inserted into a tRNA, it is converted into |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| by the enzyme |FRAME: CPLX0-3501|.  This enzyme uses two NADPH molecules to reduce the nitrile group of |FRAME: 7-CYANO-7-DEAZAGUANINE| to an amino group |CITS: [15767583]|.  The next enzyme, |FRAME: CPLX0-1101|, catalyzes a complex reaction in which |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE| is transferred into a target tRNA molecule, replacing the guanine base with the 7-aminomethyl-7-deazaguanine group at position 34 |CITS: [8323579]|.  The enzyme recognizes the anticodon region of its substrate, and only acts on tRNAs that contain a GUN sequence |CITS: [8494901]|.  The next enzyme, |FRAME: EG10812-MONOMER|, transfers a ribose moiety from |FRAME: S-ADENOSYLMETHIONINE| to the 7-aminomethyl group of |FRAME: 7-AMINOMETHYL-7-DEAZAGUANINE|, resulting in the formation of the 2,3-epoxy-4,5-dihydroxycyclopentane ring of epoxyqueuosine and releasing |FRAME: ADENINE| and |FRAME: MET| |CITS: [8347586][7849103]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Thiols play major roles in the cell in maintaining redox balance, a reduced environment, and defense against reactive oxygen species. In most organisms the major thiol is the tripeptide glutathione (&gt;-&amp;gamma;-glutamyl-L-cysteinylglycine, GSH).  Most of the glutathione pool is kept in its reduced form. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione is approximately 200:1 |CITS: [11544348]|. The functionality of glutathione largely depends on its being in a reduced form.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; two pathways utilize NADPH to reduce disulfide bonds, the thioredoxin system (see |FRAME: THIOREDOX-PWY|) and the glutaredoxin system (described here). Glutaredoxins are ubiquitous oxidoreductase enzymes that perform some essential cytoplasmic redox reactions using glutathione as an electron donor. For example they can serve as a hydrogen donor for the glutathione-dependent reduction of enzymes such as |FRAME: RIBONUCLEOSIDE-DIP-REDUCTI-CPLX|, |FRAME: PAPSSULFOTRANS-CPLX| and |FRAME: EG12237-MONOMER|. Four glutaredoxins have been identified in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, Grx1, Grx2, Grx3 and Grx4 which have both overlapping and distinct activities |CITS: [10593884][11544348][13678528][15833738][20604742]| (see |FRAME: GLUTAREDOXIN-MONOMER|, |FRAME: RED-GLUTAREDOXIN|, |FRAME: OX-GLUTAREDOXIN-B|, |FRAME: GRXB-MONOMER|, |FRAME: OX-GLUTAREDOXIN-C|, |FRAME: GRXC-MONOMER|, and |FRAME: EG12181-MONOMER|).  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  After reducing protein disulfide groups back to their native form, the resulting oxidized glutaredoxins (shown here as a class |FRAME: Ox-Glutaredoxins|) are reduced back to their active form (|FRAME: Red-Glutaredoxins|) with electrons donated by reduced glutathione molecules. In this reaction two molecules of the reduced form of glutathione are oxidized, condensing them into the single molecule glutathione disulfide. This may be a nonenzymatic process. No experimental evidence for an &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; enzyme that specifically catalyzes the reduction of Grx1, Grx2 or Grx3 was found in a literature search, although a protein disulfide oxidoreductase could hypothetically catalyze this reaction.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;H1&gt;Aerobic pathway&lt;/H1&gt;  Although enzymes of the pathway handle both short and long chain fatty acids, it is the long chain compounds that induce the enzymes of the pathway |CITS: [6271734]|.  Each turn of the cycle removes two carbon atoms until only two or three remain.  When even-numbered fatty acids are broken down, a two-carbon compound remains, acetyl-CoA.  When odd number fatty acids are  broken down, a three-carbon residue results, propionylCoA.  This is further catabolized by the reactions of proprionate catabolism.  Unsaturated fatty acids, with cis double bonds located at odd-numbered carbon atoms, enter the main pathway of saturated fatty acid degradation by converting related metabolites of cis configuration and D stereoisomers, derived from breakdown of unsaturated fatty acids, to the trans- or L isomers of saturated fatty acid breakdown by an isomerase and an epimerase, respectively.  When cis double bonds are located at even-numbered carbon atoms, such as linoleic acid (cis,cis(9,12)-octadecadienoic acid), after the fatty acid is degraded to the ten carbon stage an extra step is required to deal with the resulting compound, trans,&amp;delta;(2)-cis,&amp;delta;(4)decadienoyl-CoA.

D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and pyruvate are initially combined to yield 1-deoxy-D-xylylose 5-phosphate (DXP).  DXP is then rearranged and reduced to generate the pathway's namesake compound, 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP).  In the third reaction MEP is converted into 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methylerythritol, which is subsequently phosphorylated at the 2 position hydroxy group, yielding 4-diphosphocytidyl-2C-methylerythritol 2-phosphate.

However, the salvage pathway starts with the free base adenine and ends with the nucleotide IMP which leads to biosynthesis of other nucleotides, while this degradation pathway starts with the nucleotide form (AMP) and ends with urate.  In most organisms urate is degraded further, providing the organism with carbon, nitrogen and energy.  However, this does not appear to be the case in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.

    <attribute name="description" value="Selenocysteine has been called the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; amino acid.  It is an essential constituent of three proteins in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;: the formate dehydrogenases |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGO-CPLX &quot;FDH-O&quot;|, |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGN-CPLX &quot;FDH-N&quot;|, and |FRAME: FORMATEDEHYDROGH-MONOMER &quot;FDH-H&quot;|; each of them contains one selenocysteine residue.  The biosynthesis of selenocysteine is unique among amino acid biosyntheses because its defining step occurs while attached to a tRNA molecule.  The tRNA molecule, tRNA&lt;sup&gt;sec&lt;/sup&gt;, serves only to insert selenocysteine into these proteins.  tRNA&lt;sup&gt;sec&lt;/sup&gt; has an anticodon that recognizes the stop codon UGA; it also has properties that allow it to be charged with serine by the &lt;i&gt;serS&lt;/i&gt;-encoded seryl-tRNA synthetase.  But it cannot insert serine at an UGA codon.  Only after it has been converted to selenocysteyl-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;sec&lt;/sup&gt; by the action of selenocysteine synthetase can it recognize certain UGAs as sense codons and insert selenocysteine there.  Recognition of UGA as a sense codon and insertion of selenocysteine depends on adjacent sequences in mRNA termed SECIS (&lt;b&gt;se&lt;/b&gt;leno&lt;b&gt;c&lt;/b&gt;ysteine &lt;b&gt;i&lt;/b&gt;nsertion &lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;equence) and a special elongation factor termed SELB, the product of &lt;i&gt;selB&lt;/i&gt;, which acts in place of EF-Tu in this special case.  Selenophosphate donates selenium to seryl-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;sec&lt;/sup&gt; thereby converting it to selenocysteyl-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;sec&lt;/sup&gt;.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Glycolysis, which was first studied as a pathway for the utilization of glucose, is one of the components of central metabolism, the other two being the |FRAME:PENTOSE-P-PWY| and the |FRAME:TCA &quot;TCA cycle&quot;|. As such, its functioning is essential under all conditions of growth because it produces six (|FRAME:GLC-6-P|, |FRAME:FRUCTOSE-6P|, |FRAME:DIHYDROXY-ACETONE-PHOSPHATE|, |FRAME:G3P|, |FRAME:PHOSPHO-ENOL-PYRUVATE|, and |FRAME: PYRUVATE|) of the 13 precursor metabolites that are the starting materials for the biosynthesis of building blocks for macromolecules and other needed small molecules. Glycolysis can be found, if at least in part, in almost all organisms.  Glycolysis has evolved to fulfill two essential functions:  i) it oxidizes hexoses to generate |FRAME:ATP|, reductants and |FRAME:PYRUVATE|, and  ii) being an amphibolic pathway (pathway that involves both catabolism and anabolism), it can reversibly produce hexoses from various low-molecular weight molecules.  Because various degradation pathways feed into glycolysis at many different points, glycolysis or portions of it run in the forward or reverse direction, depending on the carbon source being utilized, in order to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites and energy. This switching of direction is possible because all but two of the enzymatic reactions comprising glycolysis are reversible, and the conversions catalyzed by the two exceptions are rendered functionally reversible by other enzymes (|FRAME:F16B-CPLX &quot;fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase&quot;| and |FRAME:PEPSYNTH-CPLX|) that catalyze different irreversible reactions flowing in the opposite direction.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The standard glycolysis pathway (|FRAME: GLYCOLYSIS|) depicts the sugar input into the pathway as glucose. However, the glycolysis pathway is utilized for the degradation of many different types of sugars.

Each of the three aspartate kinase isozymes is regulated by its corresponding end product amino acid.  The second reaction is also shared, catalyzed by aspartate semialdehyde dehydrogenase.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  All organisms living in an aerobic environment are exposed to reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are formed through metabolic processes and various environmental stresses such as drought, air pollutants, UV light and high light intensities, chilling temperatures and external chemicals |CITS: [VANBREUSGEM99][11997379]|.  For example, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced during the &amp;beta;-oxidation of fatty acids or as a result of photorespiration in photosynthetic organisms |CITS: [8819328]|.  ROS such as |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| and hydroxyl radicals as well as |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| can cause significant damage to proteins, nucleic acids and cell organelles.   Most of the aerobic organisms have developed defense systems to face oxidative stress and to scavenge oxidative radicals in the form of enzymes that can detoxify ROS, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase/hydroperoxidase (HP) |CITS: [BEYER87]|.  SODs represent the first line of defense against ROS, converting |FRAME: SUPER-OXIDE| radicals to |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| and water.  SODs are differentiated with regard to their metal cofactor.  There are iron-dependent, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent SODs, which differ not only in their metal cofactor, but also in their subcellular location. Catalase is second in the defense line against active oxygen, converting |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE| into water and oxygen.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Gram-negative bacteria commonly synthesize both cytoplasmic and periplasmic isozymes of SOD as their frontline defense against superoxide anion (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;).  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; contains two cytoplasmic SOD isozymes, one each of the manganese- and iron-cofactored types (MnSOD and FeSOD), and secretes a copper, zinc-cofactored enzyme (CuZnSOD) to the periplasm.  Periplasmic superoxide may be generated by autooxidation of dihydromenaquinone in the cytoplasmic membrane |CITS: [16923900]|.   In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTMN-CPLX &quot;MnSOD&quot;| and |FRAME: SUPEROX-DISMUTFE-CPLX &quot;FeSOD&quot;| enzymes (encoded by &lt;i&gt;sodA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;sodB&lt;/i&gt;, respectively) are structurally and kinetically similar.  Unlike MnSOD and FeSOD, |FRAME: G6886-MONOMER &quot;CuZnSOD&quot;| is monomeric |CITS: [7589534][9003353]|.  Regulation of the three enzymes is complex.  Under anaerobic conditions, FeSOD is the only superoxide dismutase enzyme present in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [321433][8002590]|.  MnSOD is induced by aerobic growth and a variety of environmental stress conditions.  CuZnSOD constitutes only a small fraction of superoxide dismutase activity in the cell; its expression is induced in stationary phase |CITS: [8626323]|.   In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, with rising H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration, catalase is strongly induced and becomes the primary scavenging enzyme.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; expresses two catalases, known as HPI and HPII, that are encoded by &lt;i&gt;katG&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;katE&lt;/i&gt;, respectively.  While &lt;i&gt;katG katE&lt;/i&gt; mutants could not degrade millimolar concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, they were subsequently found to retain the ability to degrade H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when it was present at low micromolar concentrations |CITS: [11717276]|.  This residual activity is due to an enzyme known as alkylhydroperoxide reductase (Ahp).  This two-component enzyme had originally been identified as a scavenger of organic hydroperoxides |CITS: [2643600]|.   SOD mutants of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are unable to perform normal sulfur metabolism.

Each enters the cell via a specific phosphotransferase system, so the first intracellular species is the 6-phospho-derivative (in the case of galactitol, D-galactitol-1-phosphate and D-galactitol-6-phosphate are identical).  In all three cases, this sugar alcohol phosphate becomes the substrate for a dehydrogenase that oxidizes its 2-alcohol group to a keto group.  In the cases of mannitol and sorbitol, the resulting keto sugar phosphate is D-fructose-6-phosphate, an intermediate of glycolysis and hence it flows through the pathways of central metabolism to satisfy the cell's need for precursor metabolites, reducing power, and metabolic energy.  In the case of galactitol-1-phosphate, however, the product of the dehydrogenation is tagatose-6-phosphate, which becomes the substrate of a kinase and subsequently an aldolase (in a pair of reactions that parallel those of glycolysis) before it is converted into intermediates (D-glyceraldehde-3-phosphate and dihydroxy-acetone-phosphate) of glycolysis.

The chemical nature and biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactors have been investigated in detail in bacteria |CITS: [7836363][8514783][8514782][1587808][14761975]| and plants |CITS: [16669776][16784786][12147719][16234918][9421926]|.

Both of them have been shown to exhibit CD activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [704923][1428472][12883870]|.    It was recently found that in addition to tryptophanase (TnaA) and cystathionine-&amp;beta;-lyase (MetC), three additional proteins exhibit the PLP-dependent-L-cysteine desulfhydrase (CD) activity. These are OAS sulfhydrylase A (CysK), OAS sulfhydrylase B (CysM), and the MalY protein. CysK primarily catalyzes the synthesis of L-cysteine from O-acetylserine and sulfide along the L-cysteine biosynthetic pathway. CysM is considered to be an isomer of CysK with unidentified function. MalY protein has activity of the carbon-sulfur bond cleavage (&amp;beta; C-S lyase) of cystathionine. The gene disruption for each protein significantly decreases the CD activity and is effective for overproduction of L-cysteine. The decrease in CD activity for all these genes disruption is reversed in the presence of L-cysteine except for the &lt;i&gt;tnaA&lt;/i&gt; gene disruption. This result suggests that TnaA is a key enzyme in L-cysteine degradation in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Disruption of all the &lt;i&gt;tnaA&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;metC&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cysK&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cysM&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;malY&lt;/i&gt; genes together also show much higher CD activity in the presence of L-cysteine than in its absence |CITS: [16000837][16820466]|. Unidentified proteins with CD activity are found, which may be induced by L-cysteine.  Amino acids, tryptophan, glutamic acid, and alanine inhibit the CD activity in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;. Alanine, which is most similar to cysteine in configuration, shows the greatest amount of inhibition. Tris- (hydroxymethyl)aminomethane, an effective carbonyl agent also caused significant inhibition to the CD activity |CITS: [13271322]|. "/>

Propionate can have broad negative effects on the bacterial cell functions, including cytosol acidification, dissipation of the proton motive force, disruption of CoA homeostasis, and, in some cases, inhibition of the key TCA enzymes aconitase and citrate synthase due to formation of |FRAME: CPD-622|.  For these reasons, propionate is sometimes used as a preservative in foods.  However, some bacteria are able to degrade propionate, and even use it as the sole carbon source.  Of all the propionate degradation pathways, the 2-methylcitric acid cycle is the most widely destributed.  In this pathway, the C&amp;alpha; methylene group of propionate is oxidized to a keto group yielding |FRAME: PYRUVATE|, a common precursor for biosynthesis and energy production.  The pathway, which was discovered in fungi |CITS: [Tabuchi74]|, was best characterized in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [10482501][11294638]|.

(However, |FRAME: CITRATE-SI-SYNTHASE| may also play a role in this pathway; a &lt;i&gt;gltA&lt;/i&gt; mutant has a lower growth rate on propionate than wild type |CITS: [9579066]|.)  |FRAME: CPD-622| is then dehydrated to |FRAME: CPD-1136| by |FRAME: G6199-MONOMER|, followed by rehydration to |FRAME: CPD-618| (catalyzed by |FRAME: CPLX0-7761 &quot;AcnB&quot;|) and cleavage of the latter into |FRAME: PYRUVATE| and |FRAME: SUC|, performed by |FRAME: CPLX0-1021|.

The nicotinamide ring functions as a prosthetic group for these reactions.  Their oxidized forms are depicted here as  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; due to the positive charge on the nitrogen atom in the nicotinamide ring.  Their reduced forms are referred to as NADH and NADPH.  Although they appear chemically equivalent, their metabolic roles differ.   NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is generally the cofactor for energy-producing oxidation reactions, while NADPH is the cofactor for reductive biosynthetic reactions.  The pentose phosphate pathway, the isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme (Icd) and the PntAB transhydrogenase (see below) are important sources of NADPH (in |CITS: [14660605]|).  Despite their importance, the regulation of NAD phosphorylation and dephosphorylation remains incompletely defined.  Earlier work on the kinetics of pyridine nucleotide metabolism in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated that the ratio of NADP to NAD results largely from the rates of NADP and NAD interconversion (in |CITS: [4146187]|).  The reversible reduction of both NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is carried out by the two transhydrogenase isoforms shown in the reaction links.  The PntAB product of genes &lt;i&gt;pntA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pntB&lt;/i&gt; is located in the inner membrane and also functions as a proton pump.  Its physiological function is to catalyze energy-dependent reduction of NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with NADH.  The soluble product of gene &lt;i&gt;sthA&lt;/i&gt; is thought to function mainly in the reoxidation of NADPH with NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

In contrast, NADP phosphatases (NADPases) remain poorly characterized despite their important role.  Although an NAD kinase homolog in the archaeon &lt;i&gt;Methanococcus jannaschii&lt;/i&gt; was shown to also have NADP phosphatase activity, NADP phosphatases from eubacterial and eukaryotic sources still require identification of the genes encoding them and further study of their enzymatic properties.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Most aerobic Gram-negative bacteria contain ubiquinone (Q) as the sole quinone, while most aerobic Gram-positive bacteria contain menaquinone (MK) and/or demethylmenaquinone (DMK) as the main quinone.  However, most of the anaerobic bacteria, regardless whether they are Gram-negative or Gram-positive, contain MK or DMK as their main quinones.  Some facultatively anaerobic bacteria, such as &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, contain Q, MK, and DMK, which they use under different growth conditions |CITS: [11153266]|.  DMKs are known to have side chains of different sizes in different organisms, and sometimes even within the same organism.  The most common DMKs contain 7, 8 and 9 isoprene units.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; contains demethylmenaquinone-8 (DMK-8) |CITS: [6406647]|.  DMK-8 is a low-molecular weight lipophilic component of the cytoplasmic membrane and functions as a reversible redox component of the electron transfer chain, mediating electron transfer between hydrogenases and cytochromes.    DMK is also an intermediate in MK formation (see |FRAME: PWY-5838|) |CITS: [11153266]|.  DMK-8 is methylated at the naphthoquinone ring to MK-8 by a methyltransferase, which uses S-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor |CITS: [7022156]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The conversion of 1,4-dihydroxy-2-naphthoate (DHNA) to DMK-8 in extracts of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is catalyzed by the membrane-bound 1,4-dihydroxy-2-octaprenyltransferase (MenA).  The conversion of DHNA to DMK requires replacement of the carboxyl with the isoprenoid side chain.  Prenylation and decarboxylation may occur in a single active site, since symmetry experiments exclude 1,4-naphthoquinone as an intermediate.  Moreover, there has been no evidence for two separate reaction steps or enzymes.  Based on structural and mutagenesis data, a three-stage ionization-condensation-elimination mechanism involving a carbocation intermediate has recently been proposed |CITS: [25051182]|.

Putrescine and spermidine are found in all domains of life and are the major polyamines in bacteria.  Spermine is found mostly in eukaryotes.  While polyamines are essential for normal cell growth, their specific molecular functions &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; remain poorly understood |CITS:[3157043]|.  Polyamines have been proposed to stimulate cell growth in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; through stimulation of protein synthesis (reviewed in |CITS: [16428314]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; deletion of all genes involved in polyamine biosynthesis resulted in a 40-50% reduced growth rate in amine-free medium under aerobic conditions, although polyamines were required for growth of this strain under strictly anaerobic conditions |CITS: [19542271]|.  Studies of an &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; polyamine-deficient strain showed that spermidine, as well as putrescine, plays a role as an extracellular signaling molecule in the induction of swarming and that induction is dependent on the |FRAME: ABC-24-CPLX| (PotABCD) |CITS: [20051267]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Spermidine is formed by the addition of a propylamine moiety to putrescine, catalyzed by an aminopropyltransferase termed spermidine synthase, the the product of gene &lt;i&gt;speE&lt;/i&gt; (reviewed in |CITS: [16432742]|).

There is some evidence that cadaverine, the decarboxylation product of lysine, and aminopropylcadaverine can substitute for putrescine and spermidine.  In the absence of exogenous arginine, the principal flow to putrescine and hence spermidine is via ornithine decarboxylase.  In the presence of exogenous arginine, however, when ornithine biosynthesis is halted by repression and feed-back inhibition, biosynthesis of putrescine occurs in two steps from arginine 1) by arginine decarboxylase (which is located in the periplasm so that the arginine that flows into polyamines never mixes with the intracellular pool of that amino acid) and then 2) by agmatinase which produces urea along with putrescine--the only urea-producing reaction in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.

    <attribute name="description" value="There are two pathways by which &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes glutamate from ammonia.  If complex sources of nitrogen are available, still other pathways (see below) become available and take over glutamate synthesis.   The pathway shown here synthesizes glutamate directly from ammonia, &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate, and NADPH.    The other is a cyclic pathway, which consists of two steps.  First glutamine is synthesized from ammonia and glutamate in an ATP-requiring reaction.  Then that amido group is transferred to &amp;alpha;-ketoglutrate yielding glutamate.  Because glutamine biosynthesis utilizes glutamate and the second reaction yields 2 molecules of glutamate, these two reactions function as a cycle (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|), each turn of which utilizes one molecule each of ammonia, ATP, NADPH, and &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate to produce one molecule of glutamate.  The pathway shown here also utilizes NADPH, and &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate, but it does not require ATP to drive the reaction. The K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for ammonia of this reaction is much higher than that of the ATP-driven cyclic pathway.  Expression of the two ammonia-to-glutamate pathways is regulated so that they operate under different environmental circumstances.  The ATP-independent pathway functions when ammonia is abundant; the ATP-driven pathway functions when concentrations of ammonia are low.  The ATP-independent pathway offers significant energy savings over the ATP-driven pathway, as the latter uses over 10 percent of the cell's total expenditure of ATP when it is active |CITS: [11807064]|.  If complex sources of nitrogen are available, glutamate can be synthesized from arginine (|FRAME: AST-PWY|) or proline (|FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I|) or from &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate by transamination of the amino group from arginine or aspartate.   The complexity of glutamate biosynthesis reflects the quantitatively central role that the amino acid plays in the metabolism of &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt;.  It is a major constituent of &lt;I&gt;E. coli's&lt;/I&gt; proteins and because it is a major nitrogen donor for other biosyntheses, about 80% of the cell's nitrogen flows through glutamate when &lt;I&gt;E. coli&lt;/I&gt; is growing on a medium containing ammonia as the total source of nitrogen.

Recent findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well |CITS: [15003233]|.  In animals and plants GABA is produced by the cytosolic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase.   In enteric bacteria such as &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, 4-aminobutyrate is produced by glutamate decarboxylase as part of the acid resistance system 2 (AR2) (see |FRAME: PWY0-1305|).  It is also produced as an intermediate in putrescine degradation (see |FRAME: PWY-6535|) |CITS: [20639325]|.  The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to succinate semialdehyde followed by oxidation to succinate. The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either 2-oxoglutarate in mammalian brain |CITS: [13044808]| and bacteria |CITS: [1201024]|, or pyruvate in plants |CITS: [Vancauwenberghe02]|.  Many bacteria have the ability to degrade GABA which is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay.

While some organisms such as &lt;i&gt;P. fluorescens&lt;/i&gt; can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt;, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source |CITS: [8951816][12123465]|.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can use GABA as a nitrogen source, and mutational loss of the |FRAME: EG12386-MONOMER| encoded by &lt;i&gt;csiR&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;gabC&lt;/i&gt;) allows it to utilize GABA as a carbon source |CITS: [12446648]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  GABA is transported into the cell by a specific transporter, the GabP permease as shown in the reaction link |CITS: [28310][8297211]|.  The GABA degradation pathway variant shown here includes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and a NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent dehydrogenase.    All three enzymes are induced by nitrogen limitation |CITS: [12446648]|.  &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 substr. MG1655 also has a second dehydrogenase, a |FRAME: CPLX0-7687| Sad (see |FRAME: PWY-6535|).  Only the GabD |FRAME: CPLX0-7688| is induced by GABA.  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; B also has two dehydrogenases.  A NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent enzyme is induced by growth on GABA coordinately with &amp;gamma;-aminobutyrate transaminase, and a NAD(P)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent enzyme (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-preferring) is induced by growth on &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxyphenylacetate, or exposure to exogenous succinic semialdehyde.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  |FRAME: 4-AMINO-BUTYRATE| (GABA) is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain.  Recent findings suggest that GABA has a role as a signal molecule in plants as well.   The most common path for GABA degradation involves transamination to |FRAME:SUCC-S-ALD|, followed by oxidation to |FRAME: SUC|.  Different variants of both enzymes are known.  The amino-group acceptor for the transamination can be either |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE| (e.g. in mammalian brain) or |FRAME:PYRUVATE| (e.g. in the plant |FRAME: ORG-5862|).  Different variants of the second enzyme, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase, were shown to possess different cofactor requirements, for either NAD+, NADP+, or NAD(P)+.  While there is no evidence for a special role for GABA in bacteria, the capability to degrade it exists in many strains.  GABA is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay, and many bacteria synthesize GABA as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation &quot;putrescine degradation&quot;|).   The first indication for a bacterial pathway for GABA degradation was found in |FRAME: TAX-294|.  While some organisms, like |FRAME: TAX-294|, can grow on GABA as the sole carbon and nitrogen source, others, such as |FRAME: TAX-1423|, can grow on it only as a nitrogen source.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; can utilize putrescine as the sole source of carbon and nitrogen.  The enzymes of the |FRAME: PWY0-1221| pathway are inducible by extracellular putrescine, leading to the production of GABA.  Both enzymes of this pathway are inducible by putrescine in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [20639325]|.  This variant of the pathway includes a |FRAME: 2-KETOGLUTARATE|-dependent 4-aminobutyrate transaminase and an NAD+-dependent dehydrogenase.  This combination of enzymes has been documented in bacteria and animals and in some plants.  Regarding the hydrogenase, NAD-specific variants have been studied from many bacteria, plant and animals.  |FRAME: PWY-6537|"/>

In that route GMP is synthesized via IMP and XMP, which is converted to GMP by the action of GMP synthetase, an enzyme that can use either glutamine or ammonia as substrate. Note that the free base guanine or the ribonucleoside guanosine are not produced via the &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis pathway.  Many organisms can also recycle guanosine nucleotides by a combination of degradation and salvage pathways. The degradation pathway is responsible for degradation of the nucleotides to the nucleoside guanosine and the base guanine, which can be further degraded via xanthine and urate (see pathway |FRAME: PWY-6608|).  In some organisms urate is catabolized to basic building blocks (see MetaCyc pathway |FRAME: PWY-5691|). However, both guanosine and guanine can be salvaged by certain enzymes and converted back to their nucleotide form as shown in this pathway and pathway |FRAME: PWY-6618|.  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; the pathway shown here is the major salvage route.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; phosphorolytic cleavage of the &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosyl bond of of purine ribonucleosides or deoxyribonucleosides, as shown here for guanosine, is catalyzed by the purine nucleoside phosphorylases encoded by genes &lt;i&gt;deoD&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;xapA&lt;/i&gt;. The released purine base, in this case guanine, is subsequently converted to a nucleotide, in this case GMP, by the action of phosphoribosyltransferases encoded by genes &lt;i&gt;gpt&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;hpt&lt;/i&gt;.  DeoD is the classical purine nucleoside phosphorylase I. It utilizes guanosine, adenosine, or inosine (or their corresponding deoxyribonucleosides) as substrate. Synthesis of this enzyme is induced in the presence of deoxyribonucleosides, inosine, or guanosine in the growth medium.  As shown here it cleaves guanosine to guanine and &amp;alpha;-D-ribose-1-phosphate. XapA (xanthosine phosphorylase) cleaves 6-oxopurine ribonucleosides and deoxyribonucleosides and is induced after exposure of cells to xanthosine in the medium |CITS: [7007809]|.  In the second step, the two phosphoribosyltransferases Hpt and Gpt salvage 6-oxopurine bases.  Gpt and Hpt utilize 5-phospho-&amp;alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate to convert the free base guanine to the mononucleotide GMP. As shown in &lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;, together these enzymes can rescue all 6-oxopurine bases |CITS: [4563984]|.  Review: Jensen, K.F., G. Dandanell, B. Hove-Jensen and M.

The addition of glutamyl residues probably occurs after the reduction of newly synthesized  dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and its conversion to other tetrahydrofolate derivatives.  Apparently, the glutamylation of folate residues serves several goals: it prevents the efflux of folates out of the cell,  it increases the binding of folate cofactors to the enzymes of folate interconversion and biosynthesis, and in  mammals, it allows the accumulation of folates in the mitochondria, which is required for glycine synthesis  |CITS: [10598551]|. Folylpolyglutamates are generally better substrates for folate-dependent enzymes than their monoglutamyl  counterparts. Km values decrease with increasing oligo-&amp;gamma;-glutamyl chain length |CITS: [2688305]|. At least in one case, the vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;-independent methionine synthetase, there is an absolute  requirement for the polyglutamate cofactor |CITS: [2985605]|.  In addition, many folate enzymes are multifunctional and channel one-carbon units between reactions without  achieving equilibrium with the cell medium. Therefore, the conjugated oligo-&amp;gamma;-glutamyl chain  can potentially regulate the reaction rates, and allows channeling of the substrate between enzymes in a way which  controls biosynthetic pathways |CITS: [2688305]|.   Folylpoly-&amp;gamma;-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of folates to  polyglutamates, has been purified from several organisms, including &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [2985605]|. It is a MgATP-dependent enzyme present in all cells. FPGS forms a complex with MgATP, a folate derivative,  and glutamate, in an ordered manner whereby the three substrates are added sequentially |CITS: [11501996]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, FPGS is a bi-functional enzyme, which also catalyzes the addition of glutamate  to 7,8-dihydropteroate, generating 7,8,-dihydrofolate (dihydrofolate synthetase, (E.C# 6.3.2.12).   In exponentially growing cells of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; folylpoly-&amp;gamma;- glutamates have short glutamate chain lengths:  mono- and triglutamate derivatives are most abundant, with tetra-, penta- and hexaglutamate derivatives  also present (in order of decreasing abundance). However, in stationary phase, cells contain longer-chain-length  folypolyglutamates, with the predominant chain length containing six or seven  glutamyl residues. These longer chains are generated by a second enzyme, which adds glutamate moieties in &amp;alpha;-linkage to  tetrahydropteroyl- triglutamates |CITS: [3536926]|. However, this enzyme has not been purified,  nor has the gene encoding it been identified.   Both folylpolyglutamate synthetases can accept several different folate derivatives as substrates. It seems that the preferred substrate for the addition of a second glutamate residue is 10-formyl-THF  (10-formyl-H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), while the preferred substrate for the addition of a third glutamate residue is the glutamated form of 5,10-methylene-THF (5,10-methylene-H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PteGlu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

    <attribute name="description" value="Peptidoglycan is a net-like polymer which surrounds the cytoplasmic membrane of most bacteria and functions to maintain cell shape and prevent rupture due to the internal turgor. The peptidoglycan of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 consists of glycan strands of alternating subunits of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) which are cross-linked by short peptides (|CITS: [14150645][4975910]| and see review by |CITS: [4568761]|. Synthesis of peptidoglycan is a complex two-part process which occurs across two cell compartments. The first part, assembly of a disaccharide-peptide monomer takes place in the cytoplasm and at the inner face of the inner membrane and is described in this pathway. The monomer unit is then flipped to the outer face of the inner membrane where the polymerisation and binding reactions take place (see |FRAME: PWY0-1586|).  The first 6 steps of the pathway describe the synthesis of UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide (a nucleotide activated monosaccharide-peptide) from the essential peptidoglycan precursor UDP-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-&amp;alpha;-D-glucosamine. The pentapeptide stem is attached to the lactyl group of MurNAc and contains rare D-amino acids. In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 the newly synthesized pentapeptide is formed by successive addition of L-alanine, D-glutamate, &lt;i&gt;meso&lt;/i&gt;-diaminopimelic acid (m-A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pm) and a D-alanyl-alanine dipeptide catalysed by the MurC, MurD, MurE and MurF ligases respectively (see |FRAME: PWY-6387| for more detail).  To facilitate translocation across the inner membrane the peptidoglycan precursor molecules are attached to the lipid carrier undecaprenyl phosphate which is synthesized &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; in the cytoplasm and partitioned into the inner face of the inner membrane (see |FRAME: PWY-5785|); it is also recycled as peptidoglycan is assembled in the periplasm. The enzyme MraY catalyses the reversible transfer of a phosphoMurNAc-pentapeptide from UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide to undecaprenyl phosphate in the membrane to form undecaprenyldiphospho-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanyl-&amp;gamma;-D-glutamyl-&lt;I&gt;meso&lt;/I&gt;-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine (also known as Lipid I) plus UMP |CITS: [1846850]|. This is followed by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine to form the disaccharide-pentapeptide monomer (&lt;i&gt;ditrans,octacis&lt;/i&gt;-undecaprenyldiphospho-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl-(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylglucosaminyl)muramoyl-L-alanyl-&amp;gamma;-D-glutamyl-&lt;I&gt;meso&lt;/I&gt;-2,6-diaminopimeloyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine or Lipid II) - a reaction catalysed by the MurG enzyme |CITS:[1649817],[8449890]|.

Siroheme is structurally and biosynthetically related to the corrin ring of vitamin B12. Siroheme is covalently coupled to an iron-sulfur cluster ([FeS]) to form an electronically integrated metallo-cofactor for delivering electrons to substrate. Siroheme is found as a prosthetic group of several enzymes, including sulfite and nitrite reductases, which catalyze the six-electron reductions of sulfite to sulfide and nitrite to ammonia, respectively.   The two known siroheme-containing enzymes of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; are NADPH-dependent (assimilatory) |FRAME: SULFITE-REDUCT-CPLX|, which can also function as an assimilatory nitrite reductase and NADH-dependent (dissimilatory) |FRAME: NITRITREDUCT-CPLX| |CITS: [8994874]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, siroheme is derived from uroporphyrinogen III by (i) methylation of the tetrapyrrole ring at positions 1 and 3 to form precorrin 2, (ii) oxidation of precorrin 2 to the tetrahydroporphyrin sirodihydrochlorin by removal of two electrons, and (iii) chelation of Fe2+.   Methylation of rings A and B of uroporphyrinogen III to produce precorrin 2 effectively limits subsequent oxidation beyond the tetrahydroporphyrin (dihydrochlorin) state. Oxidation of precorrin 2 to sirodihydrochlorin produces a compound that has the aromaticity and metal-binding properties necessary for efficient chelation of Fe2+.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;cysG&lt;/i&gt; is the only gene that encodes uroporphyrinogen methyltransferase.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  The nucleotides ppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-diphosphate) and pppGpp (guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate), referred to collectively as (p)ppGpp, have been shown to regulate gene expression during the stringent response in some bacteria.  Their levels become elevated during this response and they are key indicators and regulators of it.  The stringent response is a global regulatory system that operates under conditions of nutrient or energy starvation or other environmental stress.  It has varying effects on gene expression and metabolism |CITS: [18039766] [18430135]|.  In addition to bacteria, there is evidence that (p)ppGpp may regulate transcription by plastid-encoded RNA polymerase in plant chloroplasts |CITS: [19308923]|.  Due to its role as an effector molecule in the stringent response in bacteria, (p)ppGpp has been described as a bacterial alarmone.  It can contribute to the regulation of various cellular processes that are affected by nutritional stress such as growth, cell division, motility, adaptation and virulence.  Its effect on the pathogenicity of some bacteria has led to the development of ppGpp analogs as possible antibacterial compounds |CITS: [18776539]| and new &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; synthesis |CITS: [18789883]| and detection |CITS: [18166051]| methods for ppGpp.  Different bacteria have different ways of synthesizing and responding to (p)ppGpp, many of which are still being discovered.  Even in the well-studied &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; many details of ppGpp action remain to be elucidated.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [15866041] [18359660]|.  In the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; stringent response transcription, translation and DNA replication are affected by (p)ppGpp levels.  Transcription is redirected from genes related to growth to genes involved in survival under starvation and stress conditions.  The regulation of transcription by (p)ppGpp occurs at the transcription initiation stage and affects promoter use.  However, the mechanism remains unclear and direct and indirect models for regulation have been proposed.  It has been shown that ppGpp and a cofactor protein DksA bind to RNA polymerase and modulate its activity at promoters |CITS: [15294157] [15899978]|, although the exact ppGpp binding site(s) responsible for regulation are undefined |CITS: [18272182]|.  Transcription of many &amp;sigma;&lt;sup&gt;70&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent genes and genes dependent upon alternative sigma factors is negatively or positively regulated by ppGpp.  In direct models for regulation, ppGpp affects the RNA polymerase-promoter interaction via stabilization, or destabilization of the RNA polymerase-promoter open complex.  Indirect models include changes in the availability of RNA polymerase, and a role for ppGpp in regulating differential binding of sigma factors to core RNA polymerase.  Transcriptional alterations resulting from these mechanisms include repression of tRNA and rRNA synthesis (a key event in limiting the growth rate), induction of stress response factors, and induction of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport.  Reviewed in |CITS: [16554711] [15686546] [18359660]|.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; the regulation of translation by (p)ppGpp involves its repression of transcription of rRNA, tRNA and ribosomal proteins, as well as its interaction with initiation factor IF2 and possibly with elongation factors.  The regulation of DNA replication by (p)ppGpp in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; involves inhibition of the initiation step.  The demonstration that the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; DnaG primase is inhibited by ppGpp &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; also suggests inhibition of the elongation step |CITS: [19945481]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18359660]|.  In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; the products of genes &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;spoT&lt;/i&gt; have prominent roles in (p)ppGpp metabolism.  This was shown by the absence of ppGpp in &lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;spoT&lt;/i&gt; null mutants under stringent conditions |CITS: [2005134]|.  RelA functions as a synthetase and SpoT mainly as a hydrolase, although it also has synthetase activity.  Regulation of these opposing activities is critical for the ability of bacteria to respond to nutritional stress and to avoid a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p)ppGpp..  Homologous variants of the RelA and SpoT genes encoding Rsh proteins (Rel Spo homologs) are found in some bacteria and plants.  The &amp;beta;- and &amp;gamma;-proteobacteria have proteins homologous to RelA and SpoT, while most other bacteria have a bifunctional protein designated Rel.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629]|.  Experiments have shown that regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by RelA in response to amino acid starvation occurs at the level of translation on the ribosome.  Ribosome-associated RelA produces ppGpp in response to the presence of uncharged tRNA in the ribosomal A-site which results in a stalled ribosome.  Regulation of (p)ppGpp levels by SpoT is less well understood, but involves sensing other sources of nutrient stress, such as a limitation in fatty acid synthesis |CITS: [17078815]|.  SpoT also senses phosphate starvation |CITS: [17640895]| and iron limitation |CITS: [15853883]|.  Reviewed in |CITS: [18454629] [16554711]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The pathway shown here for the biosynthesis and metabolism of (p)ppGpp is based upon that shown in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]| (see reference below) except as noted.  Early kinetic studies established the overall pathway of ppGpp metabolism.  The first product of the stringent response to amino acid starvation is pppGpp which is quickly converted to the more stable compound ppGpp.  ppGpp is then hydrolyzed to GDP |CITS: [782536] [321933]|.  A role for a kinase in converting GDP back to GTP to complete a cycle was proposed early (in |CITS: [321933] [365225]|) and nucleoside diphosphate kinase, the product of gene &lt;i&gt;ndk&lt;/i&gt;, was suggested as a likely candidate.  This was supported by mutant studies in &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;Salmonella typhimurium&lt;/i&gt;) although there is no direct evidence for a unique effect of Ndk on (p)ppGpp levels in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;S. typhimurium&lt;/i&gt; (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  RelA can catalyze the conversion of both GTP to pppGpp, and GDP to ppGpp with similar &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; values derived from the Hill equation.  These values are well below the intracellular pool concentrations of GTP and ATP, but are similar to the intracellular pool concentration of GDP |CITS: [3015258]|.  Therefore pppGpp is probably the main RelA product, although both reactions are shown here (reviewed in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  In addition to a synthetase (PSI) domain, RelA also contains an inactive hydrolase domain (in |CITS: [18454629]|).  RelA is responsible for ppGpp synthesis during the stringent response to amino acid starvation.  &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; pppGpp is rapidly converted to ppGpp by Gpp (reviewed in |CITS: [15590778]|).  It is the major route of pppGpp degradation, although minor routes via enzymes with similar activity may also exist (Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  SpoT is a bifunctional enzyme with both a hydrolase activity and a weak synthetase activity (designated PSII) |CITS: [2005135] [8730877]|.  The SpoT ppGpp hydrolase activity is inhibited under conditions of physiological stress and has a major role in ppGpp degradation.  The role of the SpoT synthetase (PSII) activity is less clear.  It has been proposed to have a role in maintaining the basal level of ppGpp during exponential growth (in |CITS: [8648647]|).  SpoT also has pppGpp hydrolase activity |CITS: [365225]| and possibly pppGpp synthetase activity.  The putative SpoT pppGpp synthetase activity is based on mutant phenotype.  In &amp;Delta;&lt;i&gt;relA&lt;/i&gt;/&amp;Delta;&lt;i&gt;gpp&lt;/i&gt; mutants starved for glucose pppGpp accumulates which suggests phosphoryl group transfer to GTP as well as GDP, although the phsophoryl donor is not known (cited as unpublished data in Cashel et. al. in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|, see below).  This reaction is not shown here.  Review:  Cashel, M., D.R. Gentry, V. J. Hernandez and D. Vinella (1996) &quot;The Stringent Response&quot;, chapter 92, pp. 1458-1496, in |CITS: [ColiSalII]|."/>

In the presence of exogenous arginine, however, when ornithine biosynthesis is halted by repression and feed-back inhibition, biosynthesis of putrescine occurs in two steps from arginine 1) by arginine decarboxylase (which is located in the periplasm so that the arginine that flows into polyamines never mixes with the intracellular pool of that amino acid) and then 2) by agmatinase which produces urea along with putrescine--the only urea-producing reaction in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.

In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, two unsaturated fatty acids, palmitoleate and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate, together comprise about one-half of the total fatty acid content of the organism. Palmitate, palmitoleate and &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate make up the bulk of the fatty acids found in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; membranes |CITS: [8246839]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; has three &amp;beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS): |FRAME: FABB-CPLX|, |FRAME: 3-OXOACYL-ACP-SYNTHII-CPLX| and |FRAME: CPLX0-252|, encoded by |FRAME: EG10274|, |FRAME: EG12606| and |FRAME: EG10277|, respectively.  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the extension of a cis-&amp;delta;-5-decenoyl-[acp] to a palmitoleoyl-[acp] is believed to be catalyzed primarily by KASI. Inactivation of this enzyme leads to a lack of unsaturated fatty acids |CITS: [4901354]|. On the other hand, overexpression of KASI leads to the overproduction of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate |CITS: [6337151]|.  It has been shown that the basal ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is controlled by the level of two enzymes - |FRAME: FABA-CPLX| (|FRAME: EG10273|) and KASI |CITS: [8246839]|. The former introduces unsaturation (see |FRAME: PWY0-862|), while the other elongates the unsaturated fatty acid to the level of a palmitoleoyl-[acp] (this pathway).  Additional control over this ratio is provided by temperature. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids is known to increase in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; with lower growth temperature, a phenomenon found in most organisms that provides a mechanism for adjusting the lipid phase transition of the membrane phospholipids to differing temperatures. It has been shown that KASII which is responsible for the further elongation of the unsaturated fatty acids to the final level of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate (see |FRAME: PWY-5973|), is more active at low temperatures (relative to the overall rate of fatty acid synthesis) than at high temperatures |CITS: [7002930]|. This relative increase results in the production of &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-vaccenate  rather than palmitoleate. Because the former (but not the later) can be incorporated into both positions of |FRAME: GLYCEROL-3P|, the synthesis of di-unsaturated phospholipids occurs and the thermotrophic phase transition of the membrane phospholipids is lowered |CITS: [6988423]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Pyrimidine and purine nucleotides are components of nucleic acids in all living organisms.  Although the enzymatic steps in their &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; biosynthesis are conserved, some differences in the enzymes exist.  For example in bacteria and plants the three steps leading from carbamoyl phosphate to orotate are catalyzed by three different proteins, while in mammals they are catalyzed by a single multifunctional CAD protein.  In plants and animals the last two steps of the pathway are catalyzed by the bifunctional enzyme UMP synthase, whereas bacteria express two separate proteins for this purpose (in |CITS: [8619816][12369616]| and reviewed in |CITS: [16669783]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthetic pathway converts bicarbonate, L-glutamine, L-aspartate and 5-phospho-&amp;alpha;-D-ribose 1-diphosphate (PRPP) to uridine 5'-phosphate (UMP), a pyrimidine ribonucleotide that can be subsequently converted to other pyrimidine ribonucleotides as shown in the link at the end of this pathway, and in the superpathway links below.  The first enzyme, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, forms carbamoyl phosphate from ATP, bicarbonate, and ammonia derived from L-glutamine.  Carbamoyl phosphate is both an intermediate of pyrimidine synthesis and also a precursor for the synthesis of amino acids such as L-arginine and L-citrulline as shown in the pathway link, and L-canavanine in plants |CITS: [16480916]|.  The next step, which is catalyzed by aspartate transcarbamylase, is the condensation of carbamoyl phosphate with L-aspartate forming &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-carbamoyl-L-aspartate.  This is the committed step in pyrimidine nucleotide biosynthesis.  &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-carbamoyl-L-aspartate, is then cyclized to (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;)-dihydroorotate, the first intermediate that contains a pyrimidine ring.  This compound is oxidized to orotate by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase.  Orotate, an aromatic pyrimidine base, is therefore formed in three steps from carbamoyl phosphate.   The final two steps, the condensation of orotate with PRPP forming the first pyrimidine nucleotide orotidine 5'-phosphate (OMP), followed by the decarboylation of OMP to UMP, are carried out by the enzymes orotate phosphoribosyltransferase and orotidine 5'-phosphate decarboxylase.  UMP was identified in early work as an inhibitor of the first enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthase |CITS: [4358555]|.  In enteric bacteria the pyrimidine biosynthetic genes are scattered on the chromosome and may be a single transcriptional unit or part of a small operon.  They have their own regulatory mechanisms and are not regulated by a common repressor.    Review: Jensen, K.F., G. Dandanell, B. Hove-Jensen and M.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Backround&lt;/b&gt;  Polyamines (the most common of which are |FRAME:PUTRESCINE|, |FRAME:SPERMIDINE|, and |FRAME:SPERMINE|), a group of positively charged small molecules present in virtually all living organisms, have been implicated in many biological processes, including binding to nucleic acids, stabilizing membranes, and stimulating several enzymes |CITS: [3157043][4873311][1409623][2185470]|. Although polyamines are clearly necessary for optimal cell growth, a surplus of polyamines can cause inhibition of growth and protein synthesis |CITS: [8223591]|, and thus a balance is desired between the production and breakdown of polyamines.  Putrescine catabolism appears to be important for responding to a variety of stresses.  An &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strain that lacks both |FRAME: PUTDEG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-1221| pathways has a severe growth defect under oxidative stress conditions, and shows impaired growth at high temperature or sublethal antibiotic concentrations |CITS: [23531166]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  Several metabolic pathways for putrescine degradation as a source of nitrogen for &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 are known. The first  putrescine degradation pathway was found in in 1985 |CITS:[3897201]| (see |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY |).  That pathway is dedicated to the degradation of intracellular putrescine. A second pathway was found in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 twenty years later.  This pathway seems to be dedicated to the degradation of extracellular putrescine |CITS: [15590624]|.  The pathway was discovered following the discovery of a cluster of seven unassigned genes on the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 chromosome.  In addition to a putrescine transporter, encoded by the &lt;i&gt;puuP&lt;/i&gt; gene, the cluster contains four genes that encode the enzymes involved in this pathway, and two additional genes (&lt;i&gt;puuE&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;puuR&lt;/i&gt;) that encode an enzyme involved in the catabolism of GABA (see |FRAME: 4AMINOBUTMETAB-PWY|) and a regulator |CITS: [15590624]|.  In this pathway, putrescine is &amp;gamma;-glutamylated at the expense of an ATP molecule. The resulting  &amp;gamma;-glutamyl-putrescine is oxidized to &amp;gamma;-glutamyl-&amp;gamma;-aminobutyraldehyde, which is then dehydrogenated into 4-(glutamylamino) butanoate. In the last step, the &amp;gamma;-glutamyl group is removed by hydrolysis, generating 4-aminobutyrate.   The key difference between this pathway and |FRAME:PUTDEG-PWY| is the &amp;gamma;-glutamylation of putrescine. In the other pathway, putrescine is degraded directly to 4-amino-butanal |CITS: [15590624]|.  Wild type &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; cells are unable to utilize putrescine as the sole source of carbon at temperatures above 30&amp;deg;C |CITS: [22636776]|.  It is possible to select for mutants that possess this ability; these mutants contain elevated levels of the enzymes in this pathway |CITS: [3510672]|."/>

    <attribute name="description" value="4-aminobutyrate (or &amp;gamma;-aminobutyrate, GABA) is present in the environment as a product of plant and animal tissue decay.  In many bacteria, GABA can be synthesized as an intermediate in the degradation of putrescine (see |FRAME: Putrescine-Degradation|).  &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 can utilize GABA as the sole source of nitrogen with a slow generation time of approximately 400 minutes |CITS: [12446648]|.  It was initially reported that &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 can not utilize GABA as the sole source of either nitrogen or carbon; mutants that have gained both abilities can be isolated |CITS: [4550821]| and may affect regulation.   The first reaction of this pathway, the transfer of the amino group from GABA to 2-ketoglutarate, forming glutamate and succinate semialdehyde, can be catalyzed by two independently expressed  4-aminobutyrate aminotransferases.  Succinate semialdehyde is a toxic intermediate; two dehydrogenases with differing cosubstrate requirements catalyze its detoxification by dehydrogenation to succinate.  Mutants in the &lt;i&gt;gab&lt;/i&gt; operon are still able to grow on putrescine due to the presence of the alternative putrescine degradation pathway (|FRAME: PWY0-1221|) which includes the alternative |FRAME: G6646-MONOMER|.  While all tested nitrogen sources induce this pathway, it does not contribute to the catabolism of any other nitrogen source but GABA |CITS: [12446648]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="There are two pathways by which &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; synthesizes glutamate from ammonia.  If complex sources of nitrogen are available, still other pathways (see below) become available and take over glutamate synthesis.  The pathway shown here is one of the steps in one of the pathways by which glutamate is synthesized from ammonia.  The other step (|FRAME: GLNSYN-PWY|) in this pathway is the synthesis of glutamine from ammonia.  Then in the step shown here that amido group is transferred to &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate yielding glutamate.  Because glutamine biosynthesis utilizes glutamate and the reaction shown here yields 2 molecules of glutamate, these two reactions function as a cycle (see |FRAME: AMMASSIM-PWY|), each turn of which produces one molecule of glutamate at the expense of one molecule each of ammonia, ATP, NADPH, and &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate.  The other ammonia-to-glutamate pathway, the one catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase (|FRAME: GLUTSYNIII-PWY|), also utilizes NADPH, and &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate, but it does not require ATP to drive the reaction.  The K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for ammonia in this reaction is much higher than the K&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; for ammonia in ATP-driven cyclic pathway.  The two ammonia-to-glutamate pathways are regulated so as to operate under different environmental circumstances.  The ATP-independent pathway functions when ammonia is abundant; the ATP-driven pathway functions when concentrations of ammonia are low.  The ATP-independent pathway offers significant energy savings because when functioning, the ATP-driven pathway utilizes over 10 percent of the cell's total expenditure of ATP.  If complex sources of nitrogen are available, glutamate can be synthesized from arginine (|FRAME: AST-PWY|) or proline (|FRAME: PROUT-PWY-I|) or from &amp;alpha;-ketoglutarate by transamination of the amino group from arginine or aspartate.   The complexity of glutamate biosynthesis reflects the quantitatively central role that this amino acid plays in the metabolism of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;.  It is a major constituent of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;'s proteins and because it is a major nitrogen donor for other biosyntheses, about 80% of the cell's nitrogen flows through glutamate when &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is growing on a medium containing ammonia as the total source of nitrogen.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  In &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; 4-aminobenzoate (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-aminobenzoate) is an important metabolic intermediate that is biosynthesized from chorismate. Chorismate itself is a key metabolic branch point intermediate produced by the common pathway of aromatic biosynthesis, and is a metabolic precursor for many other pathways (as shown in the pathway links from pathway |FRAME: ARO-PWY|). 4-Aminobenzoate is a precursor of folates, as shown in the pathway link.  Folates are involved in several important metabolic functions such as synthesis of methionine, pantothenate, purines and thymidylates (for example see pathways |FRAME: HOMOSER-METSYN-PWY|, |FRAME: PANTO-PWY|, |FRAME: PWY-6123| and |FRAME: PWY0-166|). Folates are tripartite molecules composed of a pterin moiety, a 4-aminobenzoate unit, and a &amp;gamma;-linked glutamate chain.  As indicated by the pathway synonyms, in plants folate biosynthesis is segregated into three subcellular compartments, with the 4-aminobenzoate moiety produced in the plastids |CITS: [15500462][14745019]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  In early work, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 mutant strains requiring 4-aminobenzoate for growth were isolated, analyzed, and genes &lt;i&gt;pabA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;pabB&lt;/i&gt; were identified. These two genes were thought to be responsible for 4-aminobenzoate synthesis in a single step |CITS: [5337773][4914080]|. Later work revised this, showing that the PabAB enzyme forms the intermediate 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate and a second enzyme, aminodeoxychorismate lyase, catalyzes the conversion of this intermediate to 4-aminobenzoate |CITS: [2656685][2251281]|. The identity of the 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate product of PabAB was confirmed and the second enzyme was designated PabC |CITS: [ANDERSONK91]|. The &lt;i&gt;pabC&lt;/i&gt; gene was later cloned and its product was characterized |CITS: [2071583][1644759]|.    In this pathway PabA and PabB form a 1:1 heterodimeric complex that catalyzes the conversion of chorismate and glutamine to 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate. PabA functions as a glutaminase, but only when in complex with PabB. PabA alone is inactive and is therefore a conditional glutaminase that is activated by complex formation with PabB. PabB is an aminodeoxychorismate synthase that utilizes chorismate, and the nacent ammonia derived from glutamine hydrolysis by PabA, as substrates. PabC is a lyase that catalyzes the cleavage and aromatization of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate to produce 4-aminobenzoate and pyruvate |CITS: [1637823][ANDERSONK91][2251281]|.

At this point, the |FRAME: GLUCUROCAT-PWY| and |FRAME: GALACTUROCAT-PWY| pathways converge, and a common enzyme, |FRAME: DEOXYGLUCONOKIN-MONOMER|, phosphorylates 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate to yield 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate, which enters central metabolism via the |FRAME: ENTNER-DOUDOROFF-PWY|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;General Background&lt;/b&gt;  Fatty acids are key building blocks for lipids and lipoproteins in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium.  The overall mechanism of fatty acid biosynthesis is conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes and involves initiation and cyclic elongation stages.  Intermediates of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; pathway are used to form specific derivatives such as unsaturated fatty acids, the fatty acids of lipid A, and octanoyl-ACP.   There are two basic types of fatty acid biosynthesis mechanisms. The type I system is found in mammals and lower eukaryotes. The mammalian system consists of a single gene product that contains all of the reaction centers required to produce a fatty acid, while the system of lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) consists of two genes, whose polypeptide products combine to form a multifunctional complex.  Type II systems are found in bacteria, plants |CITS: [15952903]|, parasites of the phylum Apicomplexa |CITS: [17112527]|, and mitochondria |CITS: [12882974][12654921]|. The reactions in these systems are catalyzed by a series of individual soluble proteins that are each encoded by a discrete gene, and the pathway intermediates are transferred between the enzymes as thioesters of ACP.  The best studied pathway is that of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12, from which all the enzymes have been purified and crystallized. In plants fatty acid synthesis occurs mainly in plastids of leaf mesophyll cells, seeds, and oil-accumulating fruits. Although most of the synthesis occurs in plastids, it has been shown that mitochondria are also capable of synthesizing fatty acids |CITS: [14660674]|.  Fatty acid biosynthesis starts with an initiation sequence that produces an acetoacetyl-ACP, an activated molecule that is used for subsequent elongation reactions, which ultimately produce the final fatty acid products. This pathway describes only the initiation sequence, subsequent elongation reactions are described in the pathways |FRAME: FASYN-ELONG-PWY| and |FRAME: PWY0-862|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 has several different routes in which it can produce acetoacetyl-ACP, using different combinations of its three &amp;beta;-ketoacyl-ACP synthases (KAS). KASI, KASII and KASIII are encoded by &lt;i&gt;fabB&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fabF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;fabH&lt;/i&gt; respectively. In general, the &lt;i&gt;fabH&lt;/i&gt;-encoded enzyme is responsible for the initiation of fatty acid elongation, utilizing acyl-CoA primers, while the &lt;i&gt;fabB&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;fabF&lt;/i&gt; products are responsible for the subsequent rounds of elongation, condensing malonyl-ACP with different length acyl-ACPs to extend the acyl chain by two carbons |CITS: [15952903][18384517]|.  In this theoretical pathway malonyl-ACP that has been formed by the main initiation pathway (see |FRAME: PWY-4381|) is decarboxylated to acetyl-ACP in a side reaction catalyzed by KASI, which then catalyzes a second reaction, condensing the acetyl-ACP with a second malonyl-ACP, forming acetoacetyl-ACP. While these activities have been demonstrated &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; |CITS:[7002930][1551888][8246839]|, it is not clear if the pathway actually plays an important role &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, since these enzymes are believed to be primarily responsible for elongation reactions |CITS: [15952903]|.

    <attribute name="description" value="&lt;b&gt;About Lipoate&lt;/b&gt;  Lipoate is a sulfur-containing cofactor found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.  It is utilized by several enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism, including |FRAME: PYRUVATEDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, |FRAME: 2OXOGLUTARATEDEH-CPLX| |CITS: [814874][6794598][8444795]|, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase |CITS: [2188967]|, and the |FRAME: GCVMULTI-CPLX| |CITS: [1655709][8444795]|.  Each of these enzyme complexes is composed of multiple copies of three enzymes: a substrate-specific decarboxylase-dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), a dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) specific for each type of complex, and a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), a flavoprotein that is a common component of these multienzyme complexes.  &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes both the decarboxylation of the &amp;alpha;-keto acid and the subsequent reductive acylation of the lipoyl moiety, which is covalently bound to &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.  &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the acyl transfer step, and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; catalyzes the reoxidation of the dihydrolipoyl moiety with NAD as the ultimate electron acceptor |CITS: [2188967]|.  The lipoate cofactor is bound to the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by an amide linkage between its carboxylate moiety and a specific lysine residue in the enzyme |CITS: [8444795]|.  &lt;b&gt;About This Pathway&lt;/b&gt;  The biosynthesis of lipoate is unusual, and shares the same mechanism as the biosynthesis of biotin.  The first enzyme in this pathway, |FRAME: EG11591-MONOMER|, transfers the octanoate moiety from octanoate-ACP molecules to specific lysyl residues in lipoate-dependent enzymes, resulting in octanylated domains, and regenerating the acyl-carrier protein in the process |CITS: [8002607][14700636]|.  The next enzyme in the pathway, |FRAME: CPLX0-782|, catalyzes the conversion of the octanoyl side chain to an active lipoyl, generating a fully active lipoylated domain.  The enzyme is an iron-sulfur protein that requires the presence of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) |CITS: [8444795][11106496]|.  An electron which originates from the [4Fe-4S] cluster of the enzyme serves to split at least two molecules of AdoMet into a 5'-deoxyadenosyl radical and methionine |CITS: [11834738]|.  The radical then abstracts a hydrogen from a C-H bond of the octanoyl side chain, becoming 5'-adenosine in the process.  The newly-formed unstable octanoyl radical then reacts directly with the Fe-S center of the enzyme.  Two sulfur atoms from the center enter the structure of the octanoyl side chain, producing lipoyl, which dissociates from the enzyme along with excess iron, leaving it with a [2Fe-2S] center.  Thus, in this unusual reaction, the iron-sulfur center of the enzyme is not just a catalytic accelerator, but also a substrate, donating the two sulfur atoms |CITS: [11153271]|.  It should be noted that although this process has been well documented &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; |CITS: [11106496]|, there is still a possibility that there exists another sulfur donor &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that the Fe-S center acts as sulfur donor only in the absence of this natural donor |CITS: [11395404]|.  It has been suggested that the conversion of octanoylated-domains to lipoylated ones described in this pathway may be a type of a repair pathway, activated only if the other lipoate biosynthetic pathways are malfunctioning |CITS: [14700636]|.  Other routes for lipoate incorporation involve the lipoyl-protein ligase LplA, which utilizes either lipoate or octanoate imported from outside the cell (see |FRAME: PWY0-522| and |FRAME:PWY0-1275|).

    <attribute name="description" value="The |FRAME: PENTOSE-P-PWY| is one of the three essential pathways of central metabolism.  It supplies three of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;'s 13 precursor metabolites (compounds needed for the biosyntheses): D-ribose-5-phosphate, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, and erythrose-4-phosphate.  Regardless of the carbon source upon which &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; is growing, some carbon must flow through the pentose phosphate pathway to meet the cell's requirements for these metabolites.  In addition this pathway is an important source of reducing equivalents in the form of NADPH, which is also needed for biosyntheses.  The pathway begins with one intermediate of glycolysis, glucose-6-phosphate, and ends with the formation of two others, fructose-6-phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.   For convenience, the pentose phosphate pathway is commonly divided into its preliminary |FRAME: OXIDATIVEPENT-PWY &quot;oxidative portion&quot;| in which glucose-6-phosphate is oxidized to ribulose-5-phosphate, and its subsequent non-oxidative portion, shown here, in which, through a series of transaldolase and transketolase reactions, ribulose-5-phosphate is converted into fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.
